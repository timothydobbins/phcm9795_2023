## Pearson’s chi-squared test
To use Stata to perform the Chi-squared test on the data in `Example_7.1.dta` we need to have individual record data for the treatment group and presence of side effects. 

As discussed in Module 7 course notes, in this dataset `group` is coded as “1=Active” and “0 = Placebo” and `side_effect` is coded as “1 = Nausea” and “0 = No nausea”.

Follow the steps: **Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Frequency tables > Two-way table with measures of association** (as shown in the Introductory Stata workshop). In the `tabulate2` dialog box, select the variable `group` in the **Row** variable box, and the variable `side_effect` in the **Column** variable box as shown below. Tick **Pearson’s chi-squared** to obtain the Pearson’s chi-squared test or tick **Fisher’s exact test** if you have small expected cell counts (see Course Notes).

```{r tabulate2-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod07", "stata", "tabulate2-1.png"))
```

[Command: `tab group side_effect, chi2 expected row`]

To request for expected frequencies, tick the box for **Expected frequencies** and to request for the row percentage tick the box for **Within-row relative frequencies**.

Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain the Output 7.1 in the course notes.

The last line labelled Pearson chi2(1) reports the appropriate Chi-squared test statistic which has a value of 7.862 with 1 degree of freedom and a P value of 0.005.

When you only have the cross-tabulated data, you can use the `tabi` command from **Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Frequency tables > Table calculator**. In the `tabi` dialog box, enter the table in the **User-supplied cell frequencies** box as `46 4 \ 35 15` to obtain the same table as in the Output 7.1. As explained in the dialog box, each row of frequencies is separated by the backslash “\”. You can tick the same additional outputs and tests as in the tab2 command above.

```{r tabi-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod07", "stata", "tabi-1.png"))
```

[Command: `tabi 46 4 \ 35 15, chi2 exp row`]

When you are done, click OK or Submit.

## Chi-squared test for tables larger than 2-by-2
Use the data in `Example_7.2.dta`. We use similar steps as described above for a 2-by-2 table. Here we have defined the column based on sex, and we would like to obtain allergy severity by sex, so we choose "Within-column relative frequencies". We also request the expected cell counts to check the Pearson chi-squared test assumption that <20% of cells have expected cell count <5 and the minimum expected cell count is >1.

```{r tabulate2-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod07", "stata", "tabulate2-2.png"))
```

[Command: `tab allergy_severity sex, chi2 col exp`]

Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain Stata Output 7.2.

## McNemar’s test for paired proportions

To perform this test in Stata, we will use the dataset `Example_7.3.dta`. Responses to each drug should be in separate variables in the dataset as shown in Table 7.2 using the `tabulate2` command (**Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Frequency tables > Two-way table with measures of association**). In the tabulate2 dialog box, tick **Relative frequencies** under **Cell contents** as shown below.

```{r tabulate2-3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod07", "stata", "tabulate2-3.png"))
```

[Command: `tab2 drugb druga , cell`]

Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain Stata Output 7.3.

To perform the McNemar’s test, go to **Statistics > Epidemiology and related > Tables for epidemiologists > Matched case-control studies**. In the `mcc` dialog box, select the variable `drugb` as the **Exposed case variable** and `druga` as the **Exposed control variable** as shown below.

```{r mcc-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod07", "stata", "mcc-1.png"))
```

[Command: `mcc drugb druga`]
 
Click **OK** or **Submit** when you are done to obtain Stata Output 7.4.
