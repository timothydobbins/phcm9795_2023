# **4** R notes {-}

## One sample t-test

We will use data from `Example_4.1.rds` to demonstrate how a one-sample t-test is conducted in R.

```{r}
library(jmv)

bloodpressure <- read.csv("data/examples/Example_4.1.csv")

descriptives(bloodpressure)
```

To test whether the mean diastolic blood pressure of the population from which the sample was drawn is equal to 71, we can use the t.test command:

```{r}
t.test(bloodpressure$dbp, mu=71)
```

The output gives a test statistic, degrees of freedom and a P values from the two-sided test. The mean of the sample is provided, as well as the 95% confidence interval.
