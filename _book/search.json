    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nDetermining the appropriate sample size (the number of participants in a study) is one of the most critical issues when designing a research study. A common question when planning a project is “How many participants do I need?” The sample size needs to be large enough to ensure that the results can be generalised to the population and will be accurate, but small enough for the study question to be answered with the resources available. In general, the larger the sample size, the more precise the study results will be.\nUnfortunately, estimating the sample size required for a study is not straightforward and the method used varies with the study design and the type of statistical test that will be conducted on the data collected. In the past, researchers calculated the sample size by hand using complicated mathematical formula. More recently, look-up tables have been created which has removed the need for hand calculations. Now, most researchers use computer programs where parameters relevant to the particular study design are entered and the sample size is automatically calculated. In this module, we will use an abbreviated look-up table to demonstrate the parameters that need to be considered when estimating sample sizes for a confidence interval and use Stata for all other sample size calculations. The look-up table allows you to see at a glance, the impact of different factors on the sample size estimation.\n\n1.1.1 Under and over-sized studies\nIn health research, there are different implications for interpreting the results if the sample size is too small or too large.\nAn under-sized study is one which lacks the power to find an effect or association when, in truth, one exists. If the sample size is too small, an important difference between groups may not be statistically significant and so will not be detected by the study. In fact, it is considered unethical to conduct a health study which is poorly designed so that it is not possible to detect an effect or association if it exists. Often, Ethics Committees request evidence of sample size calculations before a study is approved.\nA classic paper by Freiman et al examined 71 randomised controlled trials which reported an absence of clinical effect between two treatments.(Freiman et al. 1978) Many of the trials were too small to show that a clinically important difference was statistically significant. If the sample size of an analytic study is too small, then only very limited conclusions can be drawn about the results.\nIn general, the larger the sample size the more precise the estimates will be. However, large sample sizes have their own effect on the interpretation of the results. An over-sized study is one in which a small difference between groups, which is not important in clinical or public health terms, is statistically significant. When the study sample is large, the null hypothesis could be rejected in error and research resources may be wasted. This type of study may be unethical due to the unnecessary enrolment of a large number of people."

    "text": "1.2 Sample size estimation for descriptive studies\nTo estimate the sample size required for a descriptive study, we usually focus on specifying the width of the confidence interval around our primary estimate. For example, to estimate the sample size for a study designed to measure a prevalence we need to:\n\nnominate the expected prevalence based on other available evidence;\nnominate the required level of precision around the estimate. For this, the width of the 95% confidence interval (i.e. the distance equal to 1.96 \\(\\times\\) SE) is used.\n\nTable 10.1 is an abbreviated look-up table that we can use to estimate the sample size for this type of study. Note that the sample size required to detect an expected population prevalence of 5% is the same as to detect a prevalence of 95%. Similarly 10% is equivalent to 90% etc. It is symmetric about 50%. From Table 1.1, you can see that the sample size required increases as the expected prevalence approaches 50% and as the precision increases (i.e. the required 95% CI becomes narrower).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1:  Sample size required to calculate a 95% confidence interval with a given precision \n\nWidth of 95% confidence interval (precision)\n\nPrevalence1%1.5%2%2.5%3%3.5%4%5%10%15%\n\n5% or 95%1,825812457292203149115\n\n10% or 90%3,4581,537865554385283217139\n\n15% or 85%4,8992,1771,22578454540030719649\n\n20% or 80%6,1472,7321,5379846835023852466228\n\n25% or 75%7,2033,2021,8011,1538015884512897333\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Worked Example\nA descriptive cross-sectional study is designed to measure the prevalence of bronchitis in children age 0-2 years with a 95% CI of \\(\\pm\\) 4%.

    "text": "1.3 Sample size estimation for analytic studies\nAnalytic study designs are used to compare characteristics between different groups in the population. The main study designs are analytic cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, cohort studies and randomised controlled trials. For analytic study designs, the outcome measure of interest can be a mean value, a proportion or a relative risk if a random sample has been enrolled. For case-control studies the most appropriate measure of association is an odds ratio.\n\n1.3.1 Factors to be considered\nThe first important decision in estimating a required sample size for an analytic study is to select the type of statistical test that will be used to report or analyse the data. Each type of test is associated with a different method of sample size estimation.\nOnce the statistical method has been determined, the following issues need to be decided:\n\nStatistical power: the chance of finding a difference if one exists, e.g. 80%;\nLevel of significance: the P value that will be considered significant, e.g. P<0.05;\nMinimum effect size of interest: the size of the difference between groups e.g. the difference in the proportion of parents who oppose immunisation in two different regions or the difference in mean values of blood pressure in two groups of people with different types of cardiac disease;\nVariability: the spread of the measurements, e.g. the expected standard deviation of the main outcome variable (if continuous), or the expected proportions;\nResources: an estimate of the number of participants available and amount of funding to run the study.\n\nIn addition to deciding the level of power and probability that will be used, the difference between groups that is regarded as being important has to be estimated. The smallest difference between study groups that we want to detect is described as the minimum expected effect size. This is determined on the basis of clinical judgement, public health importance and expertise in the condition being researched, or may it be need to be determined from a pilot study or a literature review. The smaller the expected effect or association, the larger the sample size will need to obtain statistical significance. We also need some knowledge of how variable the measurement is expected to be. For this we often use the standard deviation for a continuous measure. As measurement variability increases, the sample size will need to increase in order to detect the expected difference between the groups. Above all, a study has to be practical in terms of the availability of a population from which to draw sufficient numbers for the study and in terms of the funds that are available to conduct the study.\n\n\n1.3.2 Power and significance level\n\nThe power of a study, which was discussed in Module 4, is the chance of finding a statistically significant difference when one exists, i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis. The relationship between the power of a study and statistical significance is shown in Table 1.2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2:  Comparison of study result with the truth \n\nStudy resultTruth\n\n EffectNo effect\n\nEvidence✓ɑ\n\nNo evidenceβ✓\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of a study is expressed as 1– β where β is the probability of a false negative (that is, the probability of a Type II error - incorrectly not rejecting the null hypothesis. In most research, power is generally set to 80% (a Type II error rate of 20%). However, in some studies, especially in some clinical trials where rigorous results are required, power is set to 90% (a Type II error rate of 10%).\nThe significance level, or α level, is the level at which the P value of a test is considered to be statistically significant. The α level is usually set at 5% indicating a probability of <0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant. Occasionally, especially if several outcome measures are being compared, the α level is set at 1% indicating a probability of <0.01 will be regarded as statistically significant.\nThe calculation of sample sizes for analytic studies are based on calculations that are somewhat tedious to compute by hand. Software packages are the standard method of calculating sample sizes for these types of study, and examples from both R and Stata will be provided."

    "text": "1.4 Detecting the difference between two means\nThe test that is used to show that two mean values are significantly different from one another is the independent samples t-test (Module 5). The sample size needed for this test to have sufficient power can be calculated using R and Stata as shown in the Worked Example below.\n\n1.4.1 Worked Example\nThere is a hypothesis that the use of the oral contraceptive (OC) pill in premenopausal women can increase systolic blood pressure. A study was planned to test this hypothesis using a two sided t-test. The investigators are interesting in detecting an increase of at least 5 mm Hg systolic blood pressure in the women using OC compared to the non-OC users with 90% power at a 5% significance level. A pilot study shows that the SD of systolic blood pressure in the target group is 25 mm Hg and the mean systolic blood pressure of non-OC user women is 90 mm Hg. What is the minimum number of women in each group that need to be recruited for the study to detect this difference?\nSolution The effect size of interest is 5 mm Hg and the associated standard deviation is 25 mm Hg. For power of 90% and alpha of 5%, the sample size calculation using the Stata can be calculated using the power twomeans command:\n\nStata Output 10.1: Two independent samples t-test sample size calculation\n\n. power twomeans 90 95, sd(25) power(0.9)\n\nPerforming iteration ...\n\nEstimated sample sizes for a two-sample means test\nt test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd\nHo: m2 = m1 versus  Ha: m2 != m1\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500\n        power =    0.9000\n        delta =    5.0000\n           m1 =   90.0000\n           m2 =   95.0000\n           sd =   25.0000\n\nEstimated sample sizes:\n\n            N =     1,054\n  N per group =       527\n\nWe can use the epi.sscompc function within the epiR package in R to calculate the sample size:\n\nlibrary(epiR)\nlibrary(pwr)\n\nepi.sscompc(treat=90, control=95, n=NA, sigma=25, power=0.9)\n\n$n.total\n[1] 1052\n\n$n.treat\n[1] 526\n\n$n.control\n[1] 526\n\n$power\n[1] 0.9\n\n$delta\n[1] 5\n\n\nNote that Stata and R provide slightly different estimated sample sizes. This difference is immaterial from a practical point of view, and highlights the importance of referencing which software package has been used when writing up results.\nFrom the output, we can see that with 90% power we will need 526 or 527 participants in each group, i.e., 1052 or 1054 participants in total.\nIf the above were carried out by taking baseline measures of systolic blood pressure, and then again when the women were taking the OC pills, it would be a matched-pair study. Computing sample sizes for paired studies requires an estimate of the correlation between the paired obervations. If we do not have any estimates for this correlation, we can assume a value of 0. If the correlation is positive, a zero for correlation would give a more conservative estimate of sample size required (i.e. estimate a sample size larger than necessary). While a negative correlation would require a bigger sample size than a zero correlation, it is relatively uncommon to encounter negative correlations between pairs. Any discussions on the effect of correlation on sample size is beyond the scope of this course. Thus, we will always assume a correlation of zero between paired measurements in this course.\nWe can compute the required sample size in Stata using the power pairedmeans command:\n\n\nOutput 10.2: Paired samples t-test sample size using Worked Example 10.2\n\n. power pairedmeans 90 95, corr(0) power(0.9) sd(25)\n\nPerforming iteration ...\n\nEstimated sample size for a two-sample paired-means test\nPaired t test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd\nHo: d = d0  versus  Ha: d != d0\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500          ma1 =   90.0000\n        power =    0.9000          ma2 =   95.0000\n        delta =    0.1414           sd =   25.0000\n           d0 =    0.0000         corr =    0.0000\n           da =    5.0000\n         sd_d =   35.3553\n\nEstimated sample size:\n\n            N =       528\n\nAs discussed in the R notes, calculating the sample size required for a paired t-test is a little more cumbersome in R. Here, only the output of the process is provided - refer to the R notes for detail on the code.\n\n\nOutput 10.2: Paired samples t-test sample size using Worked Example 10.2\n\n\n\n     Paired t test power calculation \n\n              n = 527.2954\n              d = 0.1414214\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*\n\n\nAssuming a correlation of 0 between the two sets of measurements, we can see that we will need 528 pairs of measurements to achieve a power of 90% (virtually the same as for an independent samples study)."

Occasionally, we may not know the expected proportion in one of the groups, e.g. in a randomised control trial of a novel intervention. In the sample size calculation for such a study, we should instead justify the minimum expected difference between the proportions based on what is important from a clinical or public health perspective. Based on the minimum difference, we can then derive the expected proportion for both groups. Note that the smaller the difference, the larger the sample size required.\nThe sample size required in each group to observe a difference in two independent proportions can be calculated using the power twoproportions command in Stata.\n\n1.5.1 Worked Example\nIf we expect that the prevalence of smoking in two comparison groups (e.g. males and females) will be 35% and 20%.

    "text": "1.6 Detecting an association using a relative risk\nThe relative risk is used to describe the association between an exposure and an outcome variable if the sample has been randomly selected from the population. This statistic is often used to describe the effect or association of an exposure in a cross-sectional or cohort study or the effect/association of a treatment in an randomised controlled trial. To estimate the sample size required for the RR to have a statistically significant P value, i.e. to show a significant association, we need to define: - the size of the RR that is considered to be of clinical or public health importance; - the event rate (rate of outcome) among the group who are not exposed to the factor of interest (reference group); - the desired level of significance (usually 0.05); - the desired power of the study (usually 80% or 90%).\nIn general, a RR of 2.0 or greater is considered to be of public health importance, however, a smaller RR can be important when exposure is high. For example, there may be a relatively small risk of respiratory infection among young children with a parent who smokes (RR ~ 1.2). If 25% of children are exposed to smoking in their home, then the high exposure rate leads to a very large number of children who have preventable respiratory infections across the community.\n\n1.6.1 Worked Example\nA study is planned to investigate the effect of an environmental exposure on the incidence of a certain common disease. In the general (unexposed) population the incidence rate of the disease is 50% and it is assumed that the incidence rate would be 75% in the exposed population. Thus the relative risk of interest would be 1.5 (i.e. 0.75 / 0.50). We want to detect this effect with 90% power at a 5% level of significance.\nWe can use the Stata command power twoproportions as below:\n\n1.6.1.1 Stata Output 10.4: Sample size calculation for relative risk\n\nEstimated sample sizes for a two-sample proportions test\nPearson's chi-squared test \nHo: p2 = p1  versus  Ha: p2 != p1\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500\n        power =    0.9000\n        delta =    1.5000  (relative risk)\n           p1 =    0.5000\n           p2 =    0.7500\n        rrisk =    1.5000\n\nEstimated sample sizes:\n\n            N =       154\n  N per group =        77\n\nFrom Output 10.4, we can see that for a control proportion of 0.5 and RR of 1.5, we need a total sample size of 154, that is 77 people would be needed in each of the exposure groups.\nThe epiR package does not have a function to estimate sample size and power directly for a relative risk, but we can use the epi.sscohortc function. To do this, we recognise that the assumed rate in the exposed group will equal the rate in the unexposed group multiplied by the relative risk.\nHere we define the risk in the unexposed group as 0.5 and the desired relative risk to detect is 1.5.

    "text": "1.8 Factors that influence power\n\n1.8.1 Dropouts\nIt is common to increase estimated sample sizes to allow for drop-outs or non-response. To account for drop-outs, the estimated sample size can be divided by (1 minus the dropout rate). Consider the following case:\n\nn-completed: the number who will complete the study (i.e. n after drop-out)\nn-recruited: the number who should be recruited (i.e. n before drop-out)\nd: drop-out rate (as a proportion - i.e. a number between 0 and 1)\n\nThen n-completed = n-recruited × (1 - d)\nRe-arranging this formula gives: n-recruited = n-completed ÷ (1 - d).\n\n\n1.8.2 Unequal groups\nMany factors that come into play in a study can reduce the estimated power of a study. In clinical trials, it is not unusual for recruitment goals to be much harder to achieve than expected and therefore for the target sample size to be impossible to realise within the timeframe planned for recruitment.\nIn case-control studies, the number of potential case participants available may be limited but study power can be maintained by enrolling a greater number of controls than cases. Or in an experimental study, more participants may be randomised to the new treatment group to test its effects accurately when much is known about the effect of standard care and a more precise estimate of the new treatment effect is required.\nHowever, there is a trade-off between increasing the ratio of group size and the total number that needs to be enrolled. Consider Worked Example @ref(wex10-5): selecting an equal number of controls and cases would require 188 cases and 188 controls, a total of 376 participants.\nWe may want to reduce the number of cases required, by selecting 2 controls for every case. When performing sample size calculations with unequal groups, Stata refers to cases as N2, and controls as N1. Selecting 2 controls (N1) per case (N2) (corresponding to a ratio of N2/N1 0.5 in Stata) would require 140 cases and 280 controls, a total of 420 participants. We can extend this example and investigate the impact of changing the ratio of controls per case.\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the number of controls per case\nControls per caseStata's allocation ratio (N2/N1)     Number of cases requiredNumber of controls requiredTotal participants required\n\n11     188188376\n\n20.5   140280420\n\n30.3333124371495\n\n40.25  116462578\n\n50.2   111553664\n\n60.1666108644752\n\n70.1429105734839\n\n80.125 104825929\n\n90.11111029161,018\n\n100.1   1011,0061,107\n\n\n\n\nThis can be visualised graphically, as in Figure 1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Increasing the number of controls per case\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the number of cases required drops off if we go from 1 to 2 controls per case, and again from 2 to 3 controls per case. Once we go from 3 to 4 controls per case, we only reduce the number of cases by 8 (124 vs 116 cases), but at an increase of 91 (371 vs 462) controls. Clearly, this reduction in cases is not offset by the extra controls required.\nIn Stata, nratio is experimental group / control group.

    "text": "1.9 Limitations in sample size estimations\nIn this module we have seen how to use Stata for estimating the sample size requirement of a study given the statistical test that will be used and the expected characteristics of the sample. However, once a study is underway, it is not unusual for sample size to be compromised by the lack of research resources, difficulties in recruiting participants or, in a clinical trial, participants wanting to change groups when information about the new experimental treatment rapidly becomes available in the press or on the internet.\nOne approach that is increasingly being used is to conduct a blinded interim analysis say when 50% of the total data that are planned have been collected. In this, a statistician external to the research team who is blinded to the interpretation of the group code is asked to measure the effect size in the data with the sole aim of validating the sample size requirement. It is rarely a good idea to use an interim analysis to reduce the planned sample size and terminate a trial early because the larger the sample size, the greater the precision with which the treatment effect is estimated. However, interim analyses are useful for deciding whether the sample size needs to be increased in order to answer the study question and avoid a Type II error."

    "text": "1.10 Summary\nIn this module we have discussed the importance of conducting a clinical or epidemiological study with enough participants so that an effect or association can be identified if it exists (i.e. study power), and how this has to be balanced by the need to not enrol more participants than necessary because of resource issues. We have looked at the parameters that need to be considered when estimating the sample size for different studies and have used a look-up table to estimate required sample size for a prevalence study and Stata to estimate appropriate sample sizes in epidemiological research under the most straightforward situations. The common requirement in all the situations is that the researchers need to specify the minimum effect measure (e.g. difference in means, OR, RR etc) they want to detect with a given probability (usually 80% to 90%) at a certain level of significance (usually P<0.05). The ultimate decision on the sample size depends on a compromise among different objectives such as power, minimum effect size, and available resources. To make the final decision, it is helpful to do some trial calculations using revised power and the minimum detectable effect measure.\n\n\n\n\nBland, Martin. 2015.

We want to show that an odds ratio of 2.5 for having respiratory symptoms associated with exposure to fumes is statistically significant.\n\nWhat statistical test will be needed to measure the association between exposure and outcome?\nHow large will the sample size need to be to show that the OR of 2.5 is statistically significant at P < 0.05 with 90% power if we want to recruit equal number of cases and controls?\nWhat would be the required sample size (calculated in b) if the minimum detectable OR were 1.5?\nIf there are problems recruiting cases to detect an OR of 1.5 (as calculated in c), what would the sample size need to be if the ratio of cases to controls was increased to 1:3?\n\n\n\nActivity 10.4\nIn the above study to measure the effects of exposure to fumes from an industrial stack, we also want to know if the stack has an effect on lung function which can be measured as forced vital capacity in 1 minute (FEV1). This measurement is normally distributed in the population.\n\nIf the research question is changed to wanting to show that the mean FEV1 in the exposed group is lower than the mean FEV1 in the control group what statistical test will now be required?\nPopulation statistics show that the mean FEV1 and its SD in the general population for males are 4.40 L (SD=1.25) which can be expected in the control group.\n\nWe expect that the mean FEV1 in the cases may be 4.0 L. How many participants will be needed to show that this mean value is significantly different from the control group with P < 0.05 with an 80% power if we want to recruit equal number in each group?\n\nHow much larger will the sample size need to be if the mean FEV1 in the cases is 4.20 L?"
