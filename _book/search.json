In this module, we introduce hypothesis testing as the basis of the statistical tests that are important for reporting results from research and surveillance studies, and that you will be learning in the remainder of this course.\nWe use hypothesis testing to answer questions such as whether two groups have different health outcomes or whether there is an association between a treatment and a health outcome. For example, we may want to know:\n\nwhether a safety program has been effective in reducing injuries in a factory, i.e. whether the frequency of injuries in the group who attended a safety program is lower than in the group who did not receive the safety program;\nwhether a new drug is more effective in reducing blood pressure than a conventional drug, i.e. whether the mean blood pressure in the group receiving the new drug is lower than the mean blood pressure in the group receiving the conventional medication;\nwhether an environmental exposure increases the risk of a disease, i.e. whether the frequency of disease is higher in the group who have been exposed to an environmental factor than in the non-exposed group.\n\nWe may also want to know something about a single group. For example, whether the mean blood pressure of a sample is the same as the general population.\nThese questions can be answered by setting up a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, and performing a hypothesis test (also known as a significance test)."

    "section": "3.2 Hypothesis testing",
    "text": "3.2 Hypothesis testing\nHypothesis testing is a statistical technique that is used to quantify the evidence against a null hypothesis. A null hypothesis (H0) is a statement that there is no difference in a summary statistic between groups. For example, a null hypothesis may be stated as follows:\nH0 = there is no difference in mean systolic blood pressure between a group taking a conventional drug and a group taking a newly developed drug\nWe also have an alternative hypothesis that is opposite or contrasting to the null hypothesis. In our example above, the alternative hypothesis above we be that there is a difference between groups. The alternative hypothesis is usually of most interest to the researcher but in practice, formal statistical tests are used to test the null hypothesis (not the alternative hypothesis). The hypotheses are always in reference to the population from which the sample is drawn, not the sample itself.\nAfter setting up our null and alternative hypotheses, we use the data to generate a test statistic. The particular test statistic differs depending on the type of data being analyses (e.g. continuous or categorical), the study design (e.g. paired or independent) and the question being asked.\nThe test statistic is then compared to a known distribution to calculate the probability of observing a test statistic which is as large or larger than the observed test statistic, if the null hypothesis was true. The probability is known as the P-value. Informally, the P-value can be interpreted as the probability of observing data like ours, or more extreme, if the null hypothesis was true.\nIf the P-value is small, it is unlikely that we would observe data like ours or more extreme if the null hypothesis was true. In other words, our data are not consistent with the null hypothesis, and we conclude that we have evidence against the null hypothesis. If the P-value is not small, the probability of observing data like ours or more extreme is not unlikely. We therefore have little or no evidence against the null hypothesis. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis cannot be proven or accepted; we can only find evidence to refute the null hypothesis.\nTo summarise:\n\na small P-value gives us evidence against the null hypothesis;\na P-value that is not small provides little or no evidence against null hypothesis;\nthe smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nHistorically, a value of 0.05 has been used as a cut-point for finding evidence against the null hypothesis. A P-value less than 0.05 would be interpreted as “statistically significant”, and would allow us to “reject the null hypothesis”. A P-value greater than 0.05 would be interpreted as “not significant”, and we would “fail to reject the null hypothesis”. This arbitrary dichotomy is overly simplistic, and a more nuanced view is now recommended. Possible interpretations for P-values are given in Table 4.1.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of P-values\nSize of P valueStrength of evidence\n\n<0.001Very strong evidence\n\n0.001 to <0.01Strong evidence\n\n0.01 to <0.05Evidence\n\n0.05 to <0.1Weak evidence\n\n≥0.1Little or no evidence\n\n\n\n\nP-values are usually generated using statistical software although other methods such as statistical tables or Excel functions can be used to generate test statistics and determine the P-value. In traditional statistics, the probability level was described as a lower-case p but in many journals today, probability is commonly described by upper case P. Both have the same meaning."

    "text": "3.3 Effect size\nIn hypothesis testing, P-values convey only part of the information about the hypothesis and need to be accompanied by an estimation of the effect size, that is, a description of the magnitude of the difference between the study groups. The effect size is a summary statistic that conveys the size of the difference between two groups. For continuous variables, it is usually calculated as the difference between two mean values.\nIf the variable is binary, the effect size can be expressed as the absolute difference between two proportions (attributable risk), or as an odds ratio or relative risk.\nReporting the effect size enables clinicians and other researchers to judge whether a statistically significant result is also a clinically important finding. The size of the difference or the risk statistic provides information to help health professionals decide whether the observed effect is large and important enough to warrant a change in current health care practice, is equivocal and suggests a need for further research, or is small and clinically unimportant."

    "text": "3.4 Statistical significance and clinical importance\nWhen applying statistical methods in health and medical research, we need to make an informed decision about whether the effect size that led to a statistically significant finding is also clinically important (see Figure @ref(fig:practical-importance)). The decision about whether a statistically significant result is also clinically important depends on expert knowledge and is best made by practitioners with experience in the field.\n\n\n\nStatistical significance vs. clinical importance (Source: Armitage P, Berry G, Matthews JNS. (2001)\n\n\nIt is possible when conducting significance tests, particularly in very large studies, that a small effect is found to be statistically significant. For example, say in a large study of over 1000 patients, a new medication was found to lower blood pressure on average by 1 mmHg more than a currently accepted drug and this was statistically significant (P < 0.05). However, such a small decrease in blood pressure would probably not be considered clinically important. The cost and side effects of prescribing the new medication would need to be weighed against the very small average benefit that would be expected. In this case, although the null hypothesis would be rejected (i.e. the result is statistically significant), the result would not be clinically important. This is the situation described in scenario (c) of Figure @ref(fig:practical-importance).\nConversely, it is possible to obtain a large, clinically important difference between groups, but a P value that does not demonstrate a statistically significant difference.\nFor example, consider a study to measure the rate of hospital admissions. We may find that 80% of children who present to the Emergency Department are admitted before an intervention is introduced compared to only 65% of children after the intervention. However, the P value may be calculated as 0.11 and is non-significant. This is because only 60 children were surveyed in each period. Here, the reduction in the admission rate by 15% represents a clinically important difference, but not statistically significant. This situation is represented in scenario (d) of Figure @ref(fig:practical-importance).\nThe important thing to remember is that statistical significance does not always correspond to clinical importance. A statistically significant result may be clinically unimportant, and a statistically non-significant results may be clinically important."

If the P-value is not small, there is little evidence against the null hypothesis and we fail to reject the null hypothesis. As discussed above, the “small” cut-point for the P-value is often taken as 0.05. We refer to this value as \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha).\nWe can conduct a thought experiment and compare our hypothesis test conclusion to reality. In reality, either the null hypothesis is true, or it is false. Of course, if we knew what reality was, we would not need to conduct a hypothesis test. But we can compare our possible hypothesis test conclusions to the true (unobserved) reality.\nIf the null hypothesis was true in reality, our hypothesis test can fail to reject the null hypothesis – this would be a correct conclusion. However, the hypothesis test could lead us to rejecting the null hypothesis – this would be an incorrect conclusion. We call this scenario a Type I error, and it has a probability of \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe other situation is where, in reality, the null hypothesis is false. A correct conclusion would be where our hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis. However, if our hypothesis test fails to reject the null hypothesis, we have made a Type II error. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted \\(\\beta\\) (beta). We will see in Module 10 that \\(\\beta\\) is determined by the size of the study.\nThe error in falsely rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (type I error), or in falsely accepting the null hypothesis when it is not true (type II error) is summarised in Table @ref(tab:tab4-alpha-beta). We will return to these concepts in Module 10, when discussing how to determine the appropriate sample size of a study.\n\n\n\n\nComparison of study result with the truth\nStudy resultTruth\n\n EffectNo effect\n\nEvidenceCorrect conclusionɑ\n\nNo evidenceβCorrect conclusion"

    "text": "3.6 Confidence intervals in hypothesis testing\nIn Module 3, the 95% confidence interval around a mean value was calculated to show the precision of the summary statistic. The 95% confidence intervals around other summary statistics can also be calculated.\nFor example, if we were comparing the means of two groups, we would want to test the null hypothesis that the difference in means is zero, that there is no true difference between the groups.\nFrom the data from the two groups, we could estimate the difference in means, the standard error of the difference in means and the 95% confidence interval around the difference. To estimate the 95% confidence interval, we use the formula given in Module 3, that is:\n\\[ 95\\% \\text{ CI} = \\text{Difference in means} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(\\text{Difference in means)} \\]\nIt is important to remember that the 95% CI is estimated from the standard error, and that the standard error has a direct relationship to the sample size. For small sample sizes, the standard error is large and the 95% CI becomes wider. Conversely, the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error and the narrower the 95% CI becomes indicating a more precise estimate of the mean difference.\nThe 95% CI tells us the region in which we are 95% confident that the true difference between the groups in the population lies. If this region contains the null value of no difference, we can say that we are 95% confident that there is no true difference between the groups and therefore we would not reject the null hypothesis. This is shown in the top two estimates in Figure @ref(fig:cis-overlapping-null). If the zero value lies outside the 95% confidence interval, we can conclude that there is evidence of a difference between the groups because we are 95% confident that the difference does not encompass a zero value (as shown in the lower two estimates in Figure @ref(fig:cis-overlapping-null)).\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing confidence intervals as informal hypothesis tests\n\n\n\n\nFor relative risk and odds ratio measures, when the 95% CI includes the value of 1 it indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true RR or OR of the association between the study factor and outcome factor includes 1.0 in the source population. This indicates little evidence of an association between the study factor and the outcome factor, e.g. if the results of a study were reported as RR = 1.10 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.25). The P-value can be calculated to assess this (discussed in Module 7).\nTable 4.3 Values that indicate no effect\n\n\n\n\nValues indicating no effect\nType of outcomeMeasure of effectNull value\n\n(indicating no difference)\n\nContinuousDifference in means0\n\nBinaryDifference in proportions0\n\nRelative risk1\n\nOdds ratio1"

The t-distribution and its relation to normal distribution has been discussed in detailed in Module 3.\nIn a one-sample t-test, a t-value is computed as the sample mean divided by the standard error of the mean. The significance of the t-value is then computed in Stata or can be obtained from a statistical table.\nThe principles of this test can be used for applications such as testing whether the mean of a sample is different from a known population mean, for example testing whether the IQ of a group of children is different from the population mean of 100 IQ points or testing whether the number of average hours worked in an adult sample is different from the population mean of 38 hours.\n\n3.7.1 Worked Example\nThe mean diastolic blood pressure (BP) of the general US population is known to be 71 mm Hg. The diastolic blood pressure of 733 female Pima native Americans was measured and a histogram showed that the data were approximately normally distributed. The mean diastolic blood pressure in the sample was 72.4 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 12.38 mm Hg.\nData for this Worked Example is available on Moodle, file name Example_4.1.dta. We can use Stata to compute the significance test for a one sample t-test. The Stata results from this test is given below.\n\nStata Output 4.1: Results from one-sample t-test\n\nOne-sample t test\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVariable |     Obs        Mean    Std.

The mean diastolic blood pressure of females from Pima is estimated as 72.4 mmHg (95% CI: 71.5 to 73.3 mmHg), which is higher than that of the general US population. This interval does not contain the mean 71 mm Hg value for the general US population providing evidence that the mean diastolic blood pressure of female Pima people is higher than that of the general US population (of 71mmHg) at the 0.05 significance level.\nUnder the table, the test value of 71 (mean of the US general population) is given as the Ho (null hypothesis). Here the two-sided P-value (under Ha: mean !=71 (the alternative hypothesis) is 0.002 for a t-value of 3.0725 with 732 degrees of freedom. (In the section below, we will discuss which p-value to use from the Stata output.)\nTherefore, we can conclude that the mean diastolic BP of the female Pima people is higher than that of the general US population."

    "text": "3.8 One and two tailed tests\nMost statistical tests are two tailed tests, that is, we conduct a test that allows for the summary statistic in the group of interest to be either higher or lower than in the comparison group. For a t-test, this requires that we obtain a two-tailed P value which gives us the probability of the t-value being in either one of the two tails of the t-distribution as shown in Figure 4.3. The shaded regions show the t values that indicate a P value less than 0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\nP-value for a 2-tailed test\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally, one tailed tests are conducted in which the summary statistic in the group of interest can only be higher or lower than the comparison group, i.e. a difference is specified to occur in one direction only. This makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis because the consequence is that the P value is essentially halved. The P value for a one tailed test would be 0.025 i.e. the shaded region for a one-tailed test would be doubled on one side of the distribution and eliminated from the other side of the distribution as shown in Figure 4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\nP-value for 1-tailed tests\n\n\n\n\nIf a one tailed P value is reported, and is considered to be an invalid decision, it is usually easily converted to a two tailed value by doubling its numeric value. For example, for the same test statistic and sample size:\n\nOne tailed P value = 0.042 i.e. statistically significant\nTwo tailed P value = 0.084 i.e. non-significant\n\nObviously, the choice of whether to use a one or two tailed test is not as important when the P value is highly significant or clearly non-significant but can make a difference to the conclusions when the P value is on the margins of significance.\nIn most health research, the use of a one tailed test is rarely justified because it is unusual to be certain of the direction of effect prior to the research study being undertaken. It has been suggested that if the researchers were sure enough to consider using a one-tailed test, the research study would not be needed.\nIn most studies, two tailed tests of significance are used to allow for the possibility that the effect size could occur in either direction. In clinical trials, this would mean allowing for a result that can indicate a benefit or an adverse effect in response to a new treatment. In epidemiological studies, two tailed tests are used to allow for the fact that exposure to a factor of interest may be adverse or may be beneficial. This conservative approach is usually adopted to prevent missing important effects that occur in the opposite direction to that expected by the researchers."

For example, in an observational study, we may want to compare cholesterol levels in people who are normal weight to the levels in people who are overweight. In a clinical trial, we may want to compare cholesterol levels in people who have been randomised to a dietary modification or to usual care. In this module, we show how to compare the means of two groups where the analysis variable is normally distributed.\nFrom the decision tree presented in the Appendix, we can see that if we have a continuous outcome measure and two categorical groups that are not related, i.e. a binary exposure measurement, the test for such data is an independent samples t-test. The test is also sometimes called a 2-sample t-test.\nHowever, in research, data are often ‘paired’ or ‘matched’, that is the two data points are related to one another. This occurs when measurements are taken:\n\nFrom each participant on two occasions, e.g. at baseline and follow-up in an experimental study or in a longitudinal cohort study;\nFrom related people, e.g. a mother and daughter or a child and their sibling;\nFrom related sites in the same person, e.g. from both limbs, eyes or kidneys;\nFrom matched participants e.g. in a matched case-control study;\nIn cross-over clinical trials where the patient receives both drugs, often in random order.\n\nAn independent samples t-test cannot be used for analysing paired or matched data because the assumption that the two groups are independent is violated. Treating paired or matched measurements as independent samples would artificially inflate the sample size and lead to inaccurate P values. When the data are related in a paired or matched way and the outcome is continuous, a paired t-test is the appropriate statistic to use if the data are normally distributed."

    "text": "4.2 Independent samples t-test\nAn independent samples t-test is a parametric test that is used to assess whether the mean values of two groups are different from one another. Thus, the test is used to assess whether two mean values are similar enough to have come from the same population or whether the difference between them is so large that the two groups can be considered to have come from separate populations with different characteristics.\nThe null hypothesis is that the mean values of the two groups are not different, that is:\nH0: (Mean2 - Mean1) = 0\nRejecting the null hypothesis using an independent samples t-test indicates that the difference between the means of the two groups is large in relation to the variability in the samples and is unlikely to be due to chance or to sampling variation.\n\n4.2.1 Assumptions for an independent samples t-test\nThe assumptions that must be met before an independent samples t-test can be used are:\n\nThe two groups are independent\nThe measurements are independent\nThe outcome variable must be continuous and must be normally distributed in each group\nThe variance in the two groups is similar (homogenous)\n\nThe first two assumptions are determined by the study design. The two samples must be independent, i.e. if a person is in one group then they cannot be included in the other group, and the measurements within a sample must be independent, i.e. each person must be included in their group once only.\nThe third assumption of normality is important although t-tests are robust to some degree of non-normality as long as there are no influential outliers and, more importantly, if the sample size is large. We examined how to assess normality in Module 2. If the data are not normally distributed, it may be possible to transform them using a mathematical function such as a logarithmic transformation. If not, then we may need to use non-parametric tests. This is examined in Module 9.\nThe final assumption is homogeneity of variance between the groups. This can be verified by checking that the standard deviation (square root of the variance) of each group is similar. If the variances are different, then Welch’s t-test, an alternative version of the t-test can be used.\n\n\n4.2.2 Worked Example\nIn an observational study of a random sample of 100 full term babies from the community, birth weight and gender were measured. There were 44 male babies and 56 female babies in the sample. The research question asked whether there was a difference in birth weights between boys and girls. The two groups are independent of each other and therefore an independent samples t-test can be used to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in weight between the genders.\nSome preliminary descriptive statistics of the distribution of the variable of interest in each group should always be obtained before a t-test is undertaken to ensure that the assumptions are met. Box plots and histograms are ideal for this. Histrograms and box plots of the data obtained in Stata using Graphics > Box plot is shown in Figure @ref(fig:mod05-bwt-gender). The dataset Example_5.1.dta is available on Moodle.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms and box plots of birth weight by gender\n\n\n\n\nThe plots show that the data are approximately normally distributed: the histograms are relatively bell shaped and symmetric, and the boxes are fairly symmetrical, there are no outliers as indicated by dots, and the spread is similar in both groups as the similar length of the whiskers suggesting that the variance is homogenous.\nWe can also describe the date using summary statistics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1:  Summary of birthweight by gender \n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      Female\n      Male\n    \n  \n  \n    Birthweight\n\n\n        N\n56\n44\n        Mean (SD)\n3.59 (0.36)\n3.42 (0.35)\n        Median (IQR)\n3.53 (3.33, 3.87)\n3.43 (3.16, 3.63)\n        Range\n2.95, 4.25\n2.75, 4.10\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe table shows that girls have a mean weight of 3.59 kg (SD 0.36) and boys have a mean weight of 3.42 kg (SD 0.35) with females being heavier than males. The variabilities of birth weight, as indicated by the standard deviations, are similar.\n\n\n4.2.3 Conducting and interpreting an independent samples t-test\nAn independent samples t-test provides us with a t statistic from which we can compute a P value. The computation of the t statistic is as follows:\n\\[t = \\frac{{\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2}}{SE({\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2})}\\]\nwith n1 + n2 – 2 degrees of freedom.\nLooking at the formula for the t-statistic, we can see that the \\(t\\) is an estimate of how different the mean values are compared to their variability. So \\(t\\) will become larger as the difference in means increases with respect to the variability.\nIn Stata, both the t and P values are provided. If the t-value falls outside a critical range, the P value will be small and we can reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups.\nStata Output 5.2 shows the results of an independent samples t-test using Example_5.1.dta, obtained using Statistics - Summaries, tables, and tests - Classical tests of hypotheses - t test (mean-comparison test) and choosing the two-sample test in the ttest dialog box.\n\n4.2.3.1 Independent samples t-test, software output: Stata\n\nListing 4.1: Stata\n\n. ttest birthweight, by(gender)\n\nTwo-sample t test with equal variances\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Group |     Obs        Mean    Std.

We are 95% confident that the true mean difference lies between 0.02 and 0.31, this interval does not contain the null value of 0.\nStata reports 3 different P-values. Among them the middle one reports the P-value for a two-sided test evaluating the null hypothesis “Difference =0” and is our desired test. The test has a t-value of 2.297 with 98 degrees of freedom, and a two-sided P value of 0.024 which is less than 0.05 and is statistically significant. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis of no difference in weights between the genders."

    "text": "4.3 Paired t-tests\nIf the outcome of interest is the difference in the continuously outcome measurement between each pair of observations, a paired t-test is used. In effect, a paired t-test is used to assess whether the mean of the differences between the two related measurements is significantly different from zero. In this sense, a paired t-test is very closely aligned with a one sample t-test.\nWhen using a paired t-test, the variation between the pairs of measurements is the most important statistic. The variation between the participants is of little interest.\nFor related measurements, the data for each pair of values must be entered on the same row of the spreadsheet. Thus, the number of rows in the data sheet is the number of pairs of observations. Thus, the effective sample size is the total number of pairs and not the total number of measurements.\n\n4.3.1 Assumptions for a paired t-test\nThe assumptions for a paired t-test are:\n\nthe outcome variable is continuous\nthe differences between the pair of the measurements are normally distributed\n\nFor a paired samples t-test, it is important to test whether the differences between the two measurements are normally distributed. If the assumptions for a paired t-test cannot be met, a non-parametric equivalent is a more appropriate test to use (Module 9).\n\n\n4.3.2 Computing a paired t-test\nThe null hypothesis for using a paired t-test is as follows:\nH0: Mean (Measurement1 – Measurement2) = 0\nTo compute a t-value, the size of the mean difference between the two measurements is compared to the standard error of the paired differences, i.e.\n\\[t = \\frac{\\overline{d}}{SE(\\overline{d})}\\]\nwith n–1 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of pairs.\nBecause the standard error becomes smaller as the sample size becomes larger, the t-value increases as the sample size increases for the same mean difference.\n\n\n4.3.3 Worked Example 5.2\nA total of 107 people were recruited into a study to assess whether ankle blood pressure measured in two different sites would be the same. For each person, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured in two sites: dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior.\nThe dataset Example_5.2.dta is available on Moodle. First, we need to compute the pairwise difference between SBP measured in the two sites in Stata using the generate command. This is shown in the Stata manual at the end of this module (Checking the assumptions for a Paired t-test). The distribution of the difference between SBP measured in dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior is shown in Figure @ref(fig:mod05-sbpdiff). It approximates a normal distribution and therefore a paired t-test can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of differences in ankle SBP between two sites of 107 participants\n\n\n\n\nThe paired t-test is performed using the ttest command in Stata (see the Stata Notes section for details). We specify the data is paired with sbp_dp as First variable and sbp_tp as the Second variable. Output 5.3 shows the summary statistics for both sites. From this we can see that the mean SBP is very similar in the two sites.\n\nStata Output 5.3: Paired t-test\n\nPaired t test\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVariable |     Obs        Mean    Std.

    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nIn Module 5, we saw how to test whether the means from two groups are equal - in other words, whether a continuous variable is related to a categorical variable. We often want to know how closely two continuous variables are related. For example, we may want to know how closely blood cholesterol levels are related to dietary fat intake in adult men. To measure the strength of association between two continuously distributed variables, a correlation coefficient is used.\nWe may also want to know how well one continuous measurement predicts the value of another continuous measurement. For example, we may want to know how well height predicts values of lung capacity in a community of adults. A regression model allows us to use one measurement to predict another measurement.\nAlthough both correlation coefficients and regression models can be used to describe the degree of association between two continuous variables, the two methods provide very different statistical information. It is important to note that both methods only measures the strengths of an association between variables and does not imply a causal relationship."

    "text": "5.2 Correlation\nWe use correlation to measure the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. Before calculating a correlation coefficient, a scatter plot should first be obtained to give an understanding of the nature of the relationship between the two variables.\n\n5.2.1 Worked Example\nThe file Example_8.1.csv has information about height and lung function collected from a sample of 120 adults. A random sample of adults was approached to take part in the research study, but the response rate was low at 45%. Information was collected on height (cm) and lung function, which was measured as forced vital capacity (FVC). We can obtain a scatter-plot shown in Figure 5.1. This shows that as height increases, lung function also increases, which is as expected. One or two of the data points are separated from the rest of the data but are not so far away as to be considered outliers because they do not seem to stand out of other observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Correlation coefficients\nA correlation coefficient (r) describes how closely the variables are related, that is the strength of linear association between two continuous variables. The range of the coefficient is from +1 to −1 where +1 is a perfect positive association, 0 is no association and −1 is a perfect inverse association. In general, an absolute (disregarding the sign) r value below 0.3 indicates a weak association, 0.3 to < 0.6 is fair association, 0.6 to < 0.8 is a moderate association, and \\(\\ge\\) 0.8 indicates a strong association.\nThe coefficient is positive when large values of one variable tend to occur with large values of the other, and small values of one variable (y) tend to occur with small values of the other (x) (Figure @ref(fig:scatter-plot-four) (a and b)). For example, height and weight in healthy children or age and blood pressure.\nThe coefficient is negative when large values of one variable tend to occur with small values of the other, and small values of one variable tend to occur with large values of the other (Figure @ref(fig:scatter-plot-four) (c and d)). For example, percentage immunised against infectious diseases and under-five mortality rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter plots demonstrating strong and weak, positive and negative associations\n\n\n\n\nThe P value associated with an r value is an estimate of whether the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero. However, a correlation coefficient that does not have a significant P value does not imply that there is no relationship because the correlation coefficient only tests for a linear association and there may be a non-linear relationship such as a curved or irregular relationship.\nThe assumptions for using a Pearson’s correlation coefficient are that:\n\nobservations are independent;\nboth variables are continuous variables;\nthe relationship between the two variables is linear.\n\nThere is a further assumption that the data follow a bivariate normal distribution. This assumes: y follows a normal distribution for given values of x; and x follows a normal distribution for given values of y. This is quite a technical assumption that we do not discuss further.\nThere are two types of correlation coefficients– the correct one to use is determined by the nature of the variables as shown in Table @ref(tab:mod08-correlation-coefficients)).\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation coefficients and their application\nCorrelation coefficientApplication\n\nPearson’s correlation coefficient: rBoth variables are continuous and a bivariate normal distribution can be assumed\n\nSpearman’s rank correlation: rhoBivariate normality cannot be assumed. Also useful when at least one of the variables is ordinal\n\n\n\n\nSpearman’s \\(\\rho\\) is calculated using the ranks of the data, rather than the actual values of the data. We will see further examples of such methods in Module 9, when we consider non-parametric tests, which are often based on ranks.\nCorrelation coefficients are often presented in the form of a correlation matrix which can display the correlation between a number of variables in a single table (Table @ref(tab:corrmatrix)).\n\n(#tab:corrmatrix) Correlation matrix for Height and FVC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight\nFVC\n\n\nHeight\n1\n0.70\nP < 0.0001\n\n\nFVC\n0.70\nP < 0.0001\n1\n\n\n\nThis correlation matrix shows that the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between height and lung function is 0.70 with P<0.0001 indicating very strong evidence of a linear association between height and FVC. A correlation matrix sometimes includes correlations between the same variable, indicated as a correlation coefficient of 1. For example, \\(Height\\) is perfectly correlated with itself (i.e. has a correlation coefficient of 1). Similarly, \\(FVC\\) is perfectly correlated with itself.\nThis r value was calculated for the full data set of 120 adults who had heights ranging from 160 to 172cms. If the r value is calculated for the 60 adults with a height less than 165cms, it is much lower at 0.433 although significant at P=0.001. In general, r values are higher for a wider range of values on the x axis even though the relationship between the two variables remains the same.\nCorrelation coefficients are rarely used as important statistics in their own right because they do not fully explain the relationship between the two variables and the range of the data has an important influence on the size of the coefficient. In addition, the statistical significance of the correlation coefficient is often over interpreted because a small correlation which is of no clinical importance can become statistically significant even with a relatively small sample size. For example, a poor correlation of 0.3 will be statistically significant if the sample size is large enough."

    "text": "5.3 Linear regression\nThe nature of a relationship between two variables is more fully described using regression. There are two principal purposes for building a regression model. The most common is to build a predictive model, for example in situations in which age and gender are used to predict normal values of characteristics such as lung size or body mass index. Normal values are the range of values that occur naturally in the general population.\nThe second purpose for using a regression model is for testing the hypothesis that there is a linear relationship between one or more explanatory variables and an outcome variable. For example, a regression model can be used to test the extent to which age predicts BMI or to test the hypothesis that two groups with a different dietary regime have significantly different BMI values after adjusting for age differences.\nFrom Worked Example 8.1, we can be also plot a regression line through the scatter. Figure @ref(fig:scatter-plot-line) shows the data overlayed with the fitted regression line.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociation between height and lung function in 120 adults\n\n\n\n\nThe line through the plot is called the line of ‘best fit’ because the size of the deviations between the data points and the line is minimised in the calculation. The distance between each data point and the regression line is called a ‘residual’.\n\n5.3.1 Regression equations\nThe mathematical equation for the line explains the relationship between the two variables. The equation of the regression line is as follows:\n\\[y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x\\]\nThis line is shown in Figure @ref(fig:regression-parameters) using the notation shown in Table @ref(tab:regression-notation).\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficients of a linear regression equation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation for linear regression equation\nSymbolInterpretation\n\nyObserved value of the outcome variable\n\nxObserved value of the explanatory variable\n\nβ_0Intercept of the regression line\n\nβ_1Slope of the regression line\n\n\n\n\nThe intercept is the point at which the regression line intersects with the y-axis when the value of ‘x’ is zero. In most cases, the intercept does not have a biologically meaningful interpretation as the explanatory variable cannot take a value of zero. In our working example, the intercept is not meaningful as it is not possible for an adult to have a height of 0cm.\nThe slope of the line is the predicted change in the outcome variable ‘y’ as the explanatory explanatory variable ‘x’ increases by 1 unit.\nAn important concept is that regression predicts an expected value of ‘y’ given an observed value of ‘x’: any error around the explanatory variable is not taken into account. For this reason, measurements that can be taken accurately, such as age and height, make good explanatory variables."

The null hypotheses and the alternative hypothesis for testing the slope of a simple linear regression model are:\n\nH0: \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\nH1: \\(\\beta_1 \\ne 0\\)\n\nTo test the null hypothesis for the regression coefficient beta_1, the following t-test is used:\n\\[t = b_1 /SE(b_1)\\]\nThis will give a t statistic which can be referred to a t distribution with n − 2 degrees of freedom to calculate the corresponding P-value.\nTable @ref(tab:estimated-regression) shows the estimated regression coefficients for our working example.\n\n\n\n\nEstimated regression coefficients\nTermEstimateStandard errort valueP value95% Confidence interval\n\nIntercept-18.9 2.19 t=-8.60, 118df<0.001-23.22 to -14.53\n\nHeight0.140.013t=10.58, 118df<0.0010.11 to 0.17\n\n\n\n\nFrom this output, we see that the slope is estimated as 0.14 with an estimated intercept of -18.87. Therefore, the regression equation is estimated as:\nFVC (L) = − 18.87 + (0.14 \\(\\times\\) Height in cm)\nThere is very strong evidence of a linear association between FVC and height in cm (P < 0.001).\nThis equation can be used to predict FVC for a person of a given height. For example, the predicted FVC for a person 165 cm tall is estimated as:\nFVC = − 18.87347 + (0.1407567 \\(\\times\\) 165.0) = 4.40 L.\nNote that for the purpose of prediction we have kept all the decimal places in the coefficients to avoid rounding error in the intermediate calculation.\n\n5.5.1 Fit of a linear regression model\nAfter fitting a linear regression model, it is important to know how well the model fits the observed data. One way of assessing the model fit is to compute a statistic called coefficient of determination, denoted by \\(R^2\\). It is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient \\(r: r^2 = R^2\\). Since the range of \\(r\\) is from −1 to 1, \\(R^2\\) must lie between 0 and 1.\n\\(R^2\\) can be interpreted as the proportion of variability in y that can be explained by variability in x. Hence, the following conditions may arise:\nIf \\(R^2 = 1\\), then all variation in y can be explained by variation of x and all data points fall on the regression line.\nIf \\(R^2 = 0\\), then none of the variation in y is related to x at all, and the variable x explains none of the variability in y.\nIf \\(0 < R^2 <1\\), then the variability of y can be partially explained by the variability in x. The larger the \\(R^2\\) value, the better is the fit of the regression model.\n\n\n5.5.2 Assumptions for linear regression\nRegression is robust to moderate degrees of non-normality in the variables, provided that the sample size is large enough and that there are no influential outliers. Also, the regression equation describes the relationship between the variables and this is not influenced as much by the spread of the data as the correlation coefficient is.\nThe assumptions that must be met when using linear regression are as follows:\n\nobservations are independent;\nthe relationship between the explanatory and the outcome variable is linear;\nthe residuals are normally distributed.\n\nA residual is defined as the difference between the observed and predicted outcome from the regression model. If the predicted value of the outcome variable is denoted by \\(\\hat y\\) then:\n\\[ \\text{Residual} = \\text{observed} - \\text{predicted} = y - \\hat y\\]\nIt is important for regression modelling that the data are collected in a period when the relationship remains constant. For example, in building a model to predict normal values for lung function the data must be collected when the participants have been resting and not exercising and people taking bronchodilator medications that influence lung capacity should be excluded. In regression, it is not so important that the variables themselves are normally distributed, but it is important that the residuals are. Scatter plots and specific diagnostic tests can be used to check the regression assumptions. Some of these will not be covered in this introductory course but will be discussed in detail in the Regression Methods in Biostatistics course.\nThe distribution of the residuals should always be checked. Large residuals can indicate unusual points or points that may exert undue influence on the estimated regression slope.\nThe histogram of residuals from the model is shown in Figure @ref(fig:residual-hist). The residuals are approximately normally distributed, with no outlying values.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of regression residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Critical appraisal\nWhen reading the literature, it is important to be critical about how correlation coefficients are interpreted. It is a good idea to check if a scatter plot is shown to help interpret the relationship and to indicate if there are any potential outliers. Also, question whether the correlation coefficient has been calculated from a random sample and if not, what selected samples the value can be generalised to.\nWhen regression is reported it is essential that the axes are correctly presented so that the equation is predictive. Thus, the explanatory variable must be presented on the x axis and the outcome on the y axis. It is also a good idea to check that all the assumptions are met. Outliers which result in a non-normal distribution of the residuals can severely bias the regression coefficients."

    "text": "5.6 Multiple linear regression\nIn the above example, we have only used a simple linear regression model of two continuous variables. Other more complex models can be built from this e.g. if we wanted to look at the effect of gender (male vs. female) as binary indicator in the model while adjusting for the effect of height. In that case we would include both the variables in the model as explanatory variables. In the same way we can include any number of explanatory variables (both continuous and categorical) in the model: this is called a multivariable model. Multivariable models are often used for building predictive equations, for example by using age, height, gender and smoking history to predict lung function, or to adjust for confounding and detect effect modification to investigate the association between an exposure and an outcome factor.\nMultiple regression has an important role in investigating causality in epidemiology. The exposure variable under investigation must stay in the model and the effects of other variables which can be confounders or effect-modifiers are tested. The biological, psychological or social meaning of the variables in the model and their interactions are of great importance for interpreting theories of causality.\nOther multivariable models include binary logistic regression for use with a binary outcome variable, or Cox regression for survival analyses. These models, together with multiple regression, will be taught in PHCM9517: Regression Methods in Biostatistics.\n\n\n\n\nAcock, Alan C. 2010. A Gentle Introduction to Stata. 3rd ed.
