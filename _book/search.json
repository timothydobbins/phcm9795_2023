    "section": "1.2 Probability",
    "text": "1.2 Probability\nProbability is defined as:\n\nthe chance of an event occurring, where an event is the result of an observation or experiment, or the description of some potential outcome.\n\nProbabilities range from 0 (where the event will never occur) to 1 (where the event will always occur). For example, tossing a coin is an experiment; one event is the coin landing with head up, while the other event is the coin landing tails up. The set of all possible outcomes in an experiment is called the sample space. For example, by tossing a coin you can get either a head or a tail (called mutually exclusive events); and by rolling a die you can get any of the six sides. Thus, for a die the sampling space is: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nWith a fair (unbiased) die, the probability of each outcome occurring is 1/6 and its probability distribution is simply a probability of 1/6 for each of the six numbers on a die.\n\n1.2.1 Additive law of probability\nHow do we work out the probability that one roll of a die will turn out to be a 3 or a 6? To do that, we first need to work out whether the events (3 or 6 on the roll of a die) are mutually exclusive. Events are mutually exclusive if they are events which cannot occur at the same time. For example, rolling a die once and getting a 3 and 6 are mutually exclusive events (you can roll one or the other but not both in a single roll).\nTo obtain the probability of one or the other of two mutually exclusive events occurring, the sum of the probabilities of each is taken. For example, the probability of the roll of a die being a 3 or a 6 is the sum of the probability of the die being 3 (i.e. 1/6) and the probability of the die being 6 (also 1/6). With a fair die:\nProbability of a die roll being 3 or 6 = \\(1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3\\)\nAnother way of putting it is:\nP(die roll =3 or die roll =6) = P(die roll=3) + P(die roll=6) = \\(1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3\\)\n\nExample: Additive law for mutually exclusive events\nConsider that blood type can be organised into the ABO system (blood types A, B, AB or O) An individual may only have one blood type.\nUsing the information from https://www.donateblood.com.au/learn/about-blood let’s consider the ABO blood type system. The frequency distribution (prevalence) of the ABO blood type system in the population represents the probability of each of the outcomes. If we consider all possible blood type outcomes, then the total of the probabilities will sum to 1 (100%).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Frequency of blood types\n\n\nBlood Type\n% of population\nProbability   \n\n\nA\n38%\n0.38\n\n\nB\n10%\n0.1 \n\n\nAB\n3%\n0.03\n\n\nO\n49%\n0.49\n\n\nTotal\n100%\n1   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example we consider: What is the probability that an individual will have either blood group O or A?\nSince blood type is mutually exclusive, the probability that either one or the other occurs is the sum of the individual probabilities. These are mutually exclusive events so we can say P(O or A) = P(O) + P(A)\nThus, the answer is: P(Blood type O) + P(Blood type A) = 0.49 + 0.38 = 0.87\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Multiplicative law of probability\nThe additive law of probability lets us consider the probability of different outcomes in a single experiment. The multiplicative law lets us consider the probability of multiple events occurring in a particular order. For example: if I roll a die twice, what is the probability of rolling a 3 and then a 6?\nThese events are independent: the probability of rolling a 6 on the second roll is not affected by the first roll.\nThe multiplicative law of probability states:\n\nIf A and B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) \\(\\times\\) P(B).\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 3 and then a 6 is: P(3 and 6) = \\(1/6 \\times 1/6 = 1/36\\).\nNote here that the order matters – we are considering the probability of rolling a 3 and then a 6, not the probability of rolling a 6 and then a 3."

For example, the probability distribution for a single coin toss is straightforward: the probability of obtaining a head is 0.5, and the probability of obtaining a tail is 0.5. Similarly, the probability distribution for a single roll of a die is straightforward: each face has a probability of 1/6.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: Probability distributions for (a) a single coin toss and (b) a single roll of a die\n\n\nCoin face\nProbability\n\nFace of a die\nProbability\n\n\nHeads\n0.5\n\n1\n1/6\n\n\nTails\n0.5\n\n2\n1/6\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1/6\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1/6\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1/6\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n1/6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings become more complicated when we consider a series of coin-tosses, or rolls of a die. These series of events can be summarised by considering the number of times a certain outcome is observed. For example, the probability of obtaining three heads from five coin tosses.\nProbability distributions can be used in two main ways: 1. To calculate the probability of an event occurring. This seems trivial for the coin-toss and die-roll examples above. However, we can consider more complex events, as below. 1. To understand the behaviour of a sample statistic. We will see in Modules 3 and 4 that the mean of a sample follows a probability distribution. We can obtain useful information about a sample mean by using properties of the probability distribution."

    "text": "1.4 Discrete variables and their probability distributions\nA discrete random variable is a random variable that has countable values (non-negative integers). An example of a discrete random variable is the number of heads observed in a series of coin tosses.\nA discrete random variable can be summarised by listing all the possible values that the variable can take. As defined earlier, a table, formula or graph that presents these possible values, and their associated probabilities, is called a probability distribution.\nExample: let’s consider the number of heads in a series of three coin tosses. We might observe 0 heads, or 1 head, or 2, or 3 heads. If we let X denote the number of heads in a series of three coin tosses, then possible values of X are 0, 1, 2 or 3.\nWe write the probability of observing x heads as P(X=x). So P(X=0) is the probability that the three tosses has no heads. Similarly, P(X=1) is the probability of observing one head. The possible combinations for three coin tosses are as follows:\nThere are eight possible outcomes from three coin tosses (permutations). If we assume an equal chance of observing a head or a tail, each permutation above is equally likely, and so has a probability of 1/8.\nHowever, if we consider the possibility of observing just one head out of the three tosses, this can happen in three ways (HTT, THT, TTH). So the probability of observing one head is calculated using the additive law: P(X=1) = \\(\\tfrac{1}{8} + \\tfrac{1}{8} + \\tfrac{1}{8} = \\tfrac{3}{8}\\).\nTherefore, the probability distribution for X, the number of heads from three coin tosses, is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.3: Probability distribution for the number of heads from three coin tosses\n\n\nx (number of heads observed)\nP(X=x)\n\n\n0\n1/8\n\n\n1\n1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/8\n\n\n2\n1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/8\n\n\n3\n1/8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the probabilities sum to 1.\nThe above example was based on a coin toss, where flipping a head or a tail is equally likely (both have probabilities of 0.5). Let’s consider a case where the probability of an event is not equal to 0.5: having blood type A.\nFrom Table 1.1, the probability that a person has Type A blood is 0.38, and therefore, the probability that a person does not have Type A blood is 0.62 (1–0.38). If we considered taking a random sample of three people, the probability that all three would have Type A blood is 0.38 × 0.38 × 0.38 (using the multiplicative rule above) – and there is only one way this could happen.\nThe number of ways two people out of three could have Type A blood is 3, and each permutation is listed in Table 1.4. The probability of observing each of the three patterns is the same, and can be calculated using the multiplicative rule: 0.38 × 0.38 × 0.62 = 0.0895.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.4: Combinations and probabilities of Type A blood in three people\n\n\nPerson 1\nPerson 2\nPerson 3\nProbability\n\n\nA\nA\nA\n0.38 × 0.38 × 0.38 = 0.0549\n\n\nA\nA\nNot A\n0.38 × 0.38 × 0.62 = 0.0895\n\n\nA\nNot A\nA\n0.38 × 0.62 × 0.38 = 0.0895\n\n\nNot A\nA\nA\n0.62 × 0.38 × 0.38 = 0.0895\n\n\nA\nNot A\nNot A\n0.38 × 0.62 × 0.62 = 0.1461\n\n\nNot A\nA\nNot A\n0.62 × 0.38 × 0.62 = 0.1461\n\n\nNot A\nNot A\nA\n0.62 × 0.62 × 0.38 = 0.1461\n\n\nNot A\nNot A\nNot A\n0.62 × 0.62 × 0.62 = 0.2383\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.4 gives the probability of each of the blood type combinations we could observe in three people.

    "section": "1.5 Binomial distribution",
    "text": "1.5 Binomial distribution\nThe above are examples of the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution is used when we have a collection of random events, where each random event is binary (e.g. Heads vs Tails, Type A blood vs Not Type A blood, Infected vs Not infected). The binomial distribution calculates (in general terms):\n\nthe probability of observing k successes\nfrom a collection of n trials\nwhere the probability of a success in one trial is p.\n\nThe terms used here can be defined as: - a success is simply an event of interest from a binary random event. In the coin-toss example, “success” was tossing a Head. In the blood type example, we were only interested in whether someone was Type A or not Type A, so “success” was a blood of Type A. We tend to use the word “success” to mean “an event of interest”, and “failure” as “an event not of interest”. - the number of trials refers to the number of random events observed. In both examples, we observed three events (three coin tosses, three people). - the probability of a success (p) simply refers to the probability of the event of interest. In the coin toss example, this was the probability of tossing a Heads (=0.5); for the blood-type example, this was the probability of having Type A blood (0.38).\nPutting all this together, we say that we have a binomial experiment. To satisfy the assumptions of a binomial distribution, our experiment must satisfy the following criteria:\n\nThe experiment consists of fixed number (n) of trials.\nThe result of each trial falls into only one of two categories – the event occurred (“success”) or the event did not occur (“failure”).\nThe probability, p, of the event occurring remains constant for each trial.\nEach trial of the experiment is independent of the other trials.\n\nWe have shown in the examples above how we can calculate the probabilities for small experiments (n=3). Once n becomes large, constructing such probability distribution tables becomes difficult. The general formula for calculating the probability of observing k successes from n trials, where each trial has a probability of success of p is given by:\n\\[ P(X=k) = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\nwhere \\(n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\dots \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\nNote that this formula is almost never calculated by hand. Instructions for calculating binomial probabilities are given in the Stata and R notes at the end of this Module.\n\n1.5.1 Mean and variance of a binomial variable\nThe properties of the binomial distribution are useful in the statistical modelling of prevalence data. If X has a binomial distribution, then the mean of X is:\n\\[ E(X) = n \\times p\\] and the variance is:\n\\[ var(X) = n \\times p \\times (1-p) \\] where n = the number of trials, and p = the probability of the event occurring (or success).\n\nWorked example\nA population-based survey conducted by the AIHW (2008) of a random sample of the Australian population estimated that in 2007, 19.8% of the Australian population were current smokers.\n\nFrom a random sample of 6 people from the Australian population in 2007, what is the probability that 3 of them will be smokers?\nWhat is the probability that among the six persons, at least 4 will be smokers?\nWhat is the probability that at most, 2 will be smokers?\n\n\n\nStata Solution\n\nThe computation for binomial probabilities can be done using Stata from the main menu Data &gt; Other utilities &gt; Hand calculator as shown in the Stata Notes section.\n\nOf the three binomial functions in the Hand Calculator, we choose the binomialp function, which gives “the probability of observing k successes in n trials when the probability of a success on one trial is p”.\nWe complete the function using n=6, k=3, and p=0.198. This gives an answer of 0.08. [Command: display binomialp(6, 4, 0.198)]\n\nIn common language, getting “at least 4” smokers means getting 4, 5 or 6 smokers. Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can apply the additive law to find the probability of getting at least 4 smokers:\n\n\\[ P(X \\ge 4) = P(X=4) + P(X=5) + P(X=6) \\] Using the same binomial probability function as in the previous question,\n\nP(X=4) = 0.015 [Command: display binomialp(6, 4, 0.198)]\nP(X=5) = 0.001 [Command: display binomialp(6, 5, 0.198)]\nP(X=6) = 0.00006 [Command: display binomialp(6, 6, 0.198)]\n\nAnswer: \\(P(X \\ge 4) = 0.00006025 + 0.00146437 + 0.0148282 = 0.016\\)\nAlternatively, we can use the binomialtail function (which gives “the probability of observing k or more successes in n trials when the probability of a success on one trial is p”).\nHere, n=6, k=4 and p=0.198, giving the same answer as above: 0.016. [Command: display binomialtail(6, 4, 0.198)]\n\nObserving at most two means observing 0, 1 or 2 smokers. Therefore, the probability of observing at most 2 smokers is:\n\n\nP(X \\(\\le\\) 2) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2)\nP(X=0) = 0.266 [Command: display binomialp(6,0,.198)]\nP(X=1) = 0.394 [Command: display binomialp(6,1,.198)]\nP(X=2) = 0.243 [Command: display binomialp(6,2,.198)]\n\nAnswer: P(X \\(\\le\\) 2) = 0.266+0.394+0.243=0.903\nThis can also be done by using the binomial function (which gives “the probability of observing k or fewer successes in n trials when the probability of a success on one trial is p”).\nHere, n=6, k=2 and p=0.198, giving the same answer as above: 0.904 (note the discrepancy due to rounding error above). [Command: display binomial(6, 2, 0.198)]\n\n\nR Solution\nThe computation for binomial probabilities can be done in R using the dbinom and pbinom functions.\n\nOf the two binomial functions, we choose the dbinom(x, size, prob) function, which gives the probability of observing x successes in size trials when the probability of a success on one trial is prob.\n\nWe complete the function using x=6, size=3, and prob=0.198. This gives an answer of 0.08:\n\ndbinom(x=3, size=6, prob=0.198)\n\n[1] 0.08008454\n\n\n\nIn common language, getting “at least 4” smokers means getting 4, 5 or 6 smokers. Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can apply the additive law to find the probability of getting at least 4 smokers:\n\n\\[ P(X \\ge 4) = P(X=4) + P(X=5) + P(X=6) \\] Using the same binomial probability function as in the previous question,\n\nP(X=4) = 0.015 [Command: dbinom(x=4, size=6, prob=0.198)]\nP(X=5) = 0.001 [Command: dbinom(x=5, size=6, prob=0.198)]\nP(X=6) = 0.00006 [Command: dbinom(x=6, size=6, prob=0.198)]\n\nAnswer: \\(P(X \\ge 4) = 0.0148282 + 0.00146437 + 0.00006025 = 0.016\\)\nAlternatively, we can use the pbinom(q, size, prob, lower.tail=FALSE) function (which gives the probability of observing more than q successes in size trials when the probability of a success on one trial is prob).\nHere, q=3, size=6 and prob=0.198, giving the same answer as above: 0.016:\n\npbinom(q=3, size=6, prob=0.198, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.01635325\n\n\n\nObserving at most two means observing 0, 1 or 2 smokers.

It is characterised by its bell-shaped, symmetric curve and its tails that approach zero on either side.\nThere are two reasons for the importance of the Normal distribution in biostatistics (Kirkwood and Sterne, 2003). The first is that many variables can be modelled reasonably well using the Normal distribution. Even if the observed data were not Normally distributed, it can often be made reasonably Normal after applying some transformation of the data. The second (and possible most important) reason, is based on the central limit theorem and will be discussed in Module 3.\nThe Normal distribution is characterised by two parameters: the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). The mean defines where the middle of the Normal distribution is located, and the standard deviation defines how wide the tails of the distribution are.\nFor a Normal distribution, about 68% of the observations lie between \\(- \\sigma\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) of the mean; 95% of the observations lie between \\(−1.96 \\times \\sigma\\) and \\(1.96 \\times \\sigma\\) from the mean; and almost all the observations (99.7%) lie between \\(-3 \\times \\sigma\\) and \\(3 \\times \\sigma\\) (Figure 1.3).

    "text": "1.7 The Standard Normal distribution\nAs each Normal distribution is defined by its mean and standard deviation, there are an infinite number of possible Normal distributions. However, every Normal distribution can be transformed to what we call the Standard Normal distribution, which has a mean of zero (\\(\\mu = 0\\)) and a standard deviation of one (\\(\\sigma = 1\\)). The Standard Normal distribution is so important that it has been assigned its own symbol: Z.\nEvery observation from a Normal distribution \\(X\\) with a mean \\(\\mu\\) and a standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) can be transformed to a z-score (also called a Standard Normal deviate) by the formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\nThe z-score is simply how far an observation lies from the population mean value, scaled by the population standard deviation.\nWe can use z-scores to estimate probabilities, as shown in Worked Example 2.2.\n\nWorked Example\nThis example extends the example of diastolic blood pressure shown in Figure 2.1. Assume that the mean diastolic blood pressure for men is 77.9 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 11. What is the probability that a man selected at random will have high blood pressure (i.e. diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90)?\nTo estimate the probability that diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 (i.e. the upper tail probability), we first need to calculate the z-score that corresponds to 90 mmHg.\nUsing the z-score formula, with x=90, \\(\\mu\\)=77.9 and \\(\\sigma\\)=11:\n\\[ z = \\frac{90 - 77.9}{11} = 1.1 \\] Thus, a blood pressure of 90 mmHg corresponds to a z-score of 1.1, or a value 1.1 \\(\\times \\sigma\\) above the mean weight of the population.\nUsing a table of Z-scores (Appendix Table 1), we find the probability that a person has a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more as P(Z ≥ 1.1) = 0.136.\nAn extract from Appendix Table 1 is shown in Figure 1.4 to demonstrate how to find the probability from the look-up table.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Obtaining a probability from a table of Standard Normal distribution\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5 shows the probability of a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more in the population for a Z-score of greater than 1.1 on a Standard Normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Area under the Standard Normal curve (as probability) for Z &gt; 1.1\n\n\n\n\nApart from calculating probabilities, Z-scores are most useful for comparing measurements taken from a sample to a known population distribution. It allows measurements to be compared to one another despite being on different scales or having different predicted values.\nFor example, if we take a sample of children and measure their weights, it is useful to describe those weights as Z-scores from the population weight distribution for each age and gender. Such distributions from large population samples are widely available. This allows us to describe a child’s weight in terms of how much it is above or below the population average. For example, if mean weights were compared, children aged 5 years would be on average heavier than the children aged 3 years simply because they are older and therefore larger. To make a valid comparison, we could use the Z-scores to say that children aged 3 years tend to be more overweight than children aged 5 years because they have a higher mean Z-score for weight."

    "section": "1.8 Assessing Normality",
    "text": "1.8 Assessing Normality\nThere are several ways to assess whether a continuous variable is Normally distributed. The simple process of plotting a histogram and boxplot and comparing estimates of the centre of the data (mean and median) provide valuable information about the way in which the data are distributed.\nOther more formal measures of Normality such as skewness (whether the distribution is symmetrical or asymmetrical) and kurtosis (whether the distribution is flat or peaked) can be obtained from Stata (see Stata Notes section on Producing summary statistics in Module 1).\n\n1.8.1 Skewness and kurtosis\nSkewness is a measure of the lack of symmetry of a distribution. If the distribution is symmetric, the coefficient of skewness is 0. If the coefficient is negative, the median is usually greater than the mean and the distribution is said to be skewed left. If the coefficient is positive, the median is usually less than the mean and the distribution is said to be skewed right.\nKurtosis (from the Greek kyrtosis, meaning curvature) is a measure of peakiness of a distribution. The smaller the coefficient of kurtosis, the flatter the distribution. The Normal distribution has a coefficient of kurtosis of 3 (0 in R) and provides a convenient benchmark. If the distribution is more spread out, then the kurtosis will be greater than 3 (0 in R).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.6: Interpretation of skewness statistics\n\n\nSkewness\nInterpretation\n\n\n0\nThe distribution is symmetric\n\n\nIf skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the distribution is approximately symmetric\n\n\nNegative\nDistribution is skewed to the left (mean is usually less than the median) – aka negative skew (longer tail to the left)\n\n\nIf it is less than −1, the distribution is highly skewed to the left\n\n\nIf it is between −1 and −0.5, the distribution is moderately skewed to the left\n\n\nPositive\nDistribution is skewed to the right (mean is usually greater than the median) – aka positive skew (longer tail to the right)\n\n\nIf it is greater than 1, the distribution is highly skewed to the right\n\n\nIf it is between 1 and 0.5, the distribution is moderately skewed to the right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor your information: There are formal tests in Stata and R that test for Normality. These tests are beyond the scope of this course and will be discussed in the Advanced course.\nThe histogram for our 30 weights is approximately bell-shaped and roughly symmetrical. The mean and median (50th percentile) values are identical, as would be expected for a Normal distribution. These statistics indicate that the data are Normally distributed. Finally, you can look at the histogram and boxplot (Figure 1.6) to assess symmetry and outliers at either end of the distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Histogram and boxplot of weight of 30 students attending a gym\n\n\n\n\nA summary of how to explore Normality is shown in Table 1.7.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.7: Methods to assess Normality\n\n\nMethod\nIndication of Normality\n\n\nExamine histogram\nApproximately bell shaped and symmetrical; may be difficult to determine if the sample size is small\n\n\nCompare mean and median values\nValues are approximately equal\n\n\nExamine box plot\nBox plot symmetrical with no outliers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to look at all these measures together, and not rely on a single measure when assessing whether a sample is approximately Normally distributed. For small samples, it can be very difficult to determine whether the data are approximately Normally distributed."

    "section": "1.9 Non-Normally distributed measurements",
    "text": "1.9 Non-Normally distributed measurements\nIn the above example, diastolic blood pressure was Normally distributed with an approximately bell-shaped frequency histogram. However, not all measurements are Normally distributed, and the symmetry of the bell shape may be distorted by the presence of some very small or very large values. Non-Normal distributions such as this are called skewed distributions.\nWhen there are some very large values, the distribution is said to be positively skewed.This often occurs when measuring variables related to time, such as days of hospital stay, where most patients have short stays (say 1 - 5 days) but a few patients with serious medical conditions have very long lengths of hospital stay (say 20 - 100 days).\nIn practice, most parametric summary statistics are quite robust to minor deviations from Normality and non-parametric statistical methods are only required when the sample size is small and/or the data are obviously skewed with some influential outliers.\nWhen the data are markedly skewed, histograms and boxplots can look very different. For example, data of length of hospital stay in a sample of children are shown as a histogram and as a box plot in Figure 1.7.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Histogram and boxplot of length of stay\n\n\n\n\nIn the histogram of Figure 1.7, there is a tail of values to the right, so we would conclude that the distribution is skewed to the right. In the boxplot, the whiskers appear to be fairly symmetric, but there are some unusual values (denoted by dots) above the box and its whiskers. Stata defines these unusual values as being more than 1.5 times the IQR from the edge of the box.\nThe presence of unusual values may be an indication that the data are not Normally distributed. Both the histogram and the box plot show that the distribution has a marked tail towards high values and that non-parametric statistics should be used to generate summary statistics and analyse the data.\nNote that Stata has defined points as being unusual, or outliers. Outliers can be problematic and the decision to include them or omit them from further analyses can be difficult. After detecting any outliers or extreme values, you should not automatically exclude them from the analysis, particularly if the sample was selected randomly from a population. First, it is important to check the original data collection form or questionnaire to rule out the possibility of a data entry error. If the outlier is not a data entry error, it is then important to decide whether the observation is biologically plausible and, if it is, it should be included in the analysis.\n\n1.9.1 Which measure of central tendency to use\nIt is most appropriate to use the mean when the data exhibit a symmetric or bell-shaped distribution. For skewed distributions (where there are more values on the higher (negative skew) or lower side (positive skew) of the scale) the mean is not a good measure of the centre, as the calculation will be influenced by the extreme values. The median is the preferred statistic for describing central tendency in a skewed distribution.\nIf the data exhibits a Normal distribution, we use the standard deviation as the measure of spread. Otherwise, the interquartile range is preferred."

Many methods of statistical inferences based on theoretical sampling properties that are derived from a Normal distribution with the characteristics described above. Thus, it is important that measurements approximate to a Normal distribution before these parametric methods are used. The methods are called ‘parametric’ because they are based on the parameters – the mean and standard deviation - that underlie a Normal distribution. Statistics which do not assume a particular distribution are called distribution-free statistics, or ‘non-parametric statistics’.\nIn this course, you will learn about both parametric and non-parametric statistical methods. Parametric summary statistical methods include those based on the mean, standard deviation and range (Module 1), and standard error and 95% confidence interval (Module 3). Parametric statistical tests also include t-tests which will be covered in Modules 4 and 5, and correlation and regression described in Module 8.\nNon-parametric summary statistical methods are often based on ranks, and may use such statistics as the median, mode and inter-quartile range (Module 1). Non-parametric statistical tests that use ranking are described in Module 9."

    "text": "1.11 Other types of probability distributions\nIn this module we have considered a Normal probability distribution and how to use it to measure the precision of continuously distributed measurements. Data also follow other types of distributions which are briefly described below. In other modules in this course, we will be looking at a range of methods to analyse health data and will refer back to these different distributions.\nNormal approximation of binomial: When the sample size becomes large, it becomes cumbersome to calculate the exact probability of an event using the binomial distribution. Conveniently, with large sample sizes, the binomial distribution approximates a Normal distribution. The mean and SD of a binomial distribution can be used to calculate the probability of the event as though it was from a Normal distribution.\nPoisson distribution: is another distribution which is often used in health research for modelling count data. The Poisson distribution is followed when a number of events happen in a fixed time interval. This distribution is useful for describing data such as deaths in the population in a time period. For example, the number of deaths from breast cancer in one year in women over 50 years old will be an observation from a Poisson distribution. We can also use this to make comparisons of mortality rates between populations.\nMany other probability distributions can be derived for functions which arise in statistical analyses but the chi-squared, t and F distributions are the three distributions that are most widely used. These have many applications, some of which are described in later modules.\nThe chi-squared distribution is a skewed distribution which allows us to determine the probability of a deviation between a count that we observe and a count that we expect for categorical data. One use of this is in conducting statistical tests for categorical data. See Module 7.\nA t-distribution is used when the population standard deviation is not known. The t-distribution is appropriate for small samples (&lt;30) and its distribution is bell shaped similar to a Normal distribution but slightly flatter. The t-distribution is useful for comparing mean values. See Module 4 and Module 5."

While they can be opened by Microsoft Excel, they can be opened by many other programs: the csv file can be thought of as the lingua-franca of data.\nIn this demonstration, we will use data on the weight of 1000 people entered in a csv file called mod02_weight_1000.csv available on Moodle.

    "text": "1.13 Checking your data for errors in Stata\nBefore you start describing and analysing your data, it is important to make sure that no errors have been made during the data entry process. Basically, you are looking for values that are outside the range of possible or plausible values for that variable.\nIf an error is found, the best method for correcting the error is to go back to the original data e.g. the hard copy questionnaire, to obtain the original value, entering the correct value into Stata. If the original data is not available or the original data is also incorrect, the erroneous value is often excluded from the dataset.\nFor continuous variables, the easiest methods are to examine a boxplot and histogram. For example, a boxplot and histogram for the weight variable we just imported appear as:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear outlying point shown in the boxplot. Although not obvious, the same point is shown in the histogram as a bar around 700 with a very short height.\nTo identify the outlying observation in the dataset, we can sort your data in ascending order and check the minimum and maximum values in the Data Editor. You will need to decide if these values are a data entry error or are biologically plausible. If an extreme value or “outlier”, is biologically plausible, it should be included in all analyses.\nTo sort data, you must be in the Data Editor (Edit) window. Select Data &gt; Sort data… and choose weight as shown in the sort dialog box below. Click OK to do an ascending sort (arranging weight from smallest to largest). [Command: sort weight]\n\n\n\n\n\nBy scrolling through the data, you will see that the values range from 53.8kg to 85.8kg with a very high value of 700.2kg. A value as high as 700kg is likely to be a data entry error (e.g. error in entering an extra zero) and is not a plausible weight value. Here, you should check your original data. You might find that the original weight was recorded as 70.2kg. You can change this in Stata by deleting a zero from cell with 700.2 in the Data Editor (Edit) window.\nNote: if an extreme value lies within the range of biological plausibility it should not be removed from analysis.\nOnce you have checked your data for errors, you are ready to start analysing your data."

Double click on binomialp() which will populate the top of the expression builder box with binomialp(n,k,p). Following the instructions at the bottom of the box:\n\nk is the number of successes, here, the number of smokers (i.e. k=3);\nn is the number of trials (i.e. n=6);\nand p is probability of drawing a smoker from the population, which is 19.8% (i.e. p=0.198).\n\nReplace each of these with the appropriate number into the box as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the OK button in the Expression Builder box, then click OK or Submit in the main dialog box. The probability is now displayed on your Results screen as .08008454 which rounds off to 0.08 as shown in part (a) of Worked Example 2.1.

    "text": "1.22 Importing data into R\nWe have described previously how to import data that have been saved as R .rds files. It is quite common to have data saved in other file types, such as Microsoft Excel, or plain text files. In this section, we will demonstrate how to import data from other packages into R.\nThere are two useful packages for importing data into R: haven (for data that have been saved by Stata, SAS or SPSS) and readxl (for data saved by Microsoft Excel). Additionally, the labelled package is useful in working with data that have been labelled in Stata.\n\n1.22.1 Importing plain text data into R\nA csv file, or a “comma separated variables” file is commonly used to store data. These files have a very simple structure: they are plain text files, where data are separated by commas. csv files have the advantage that, as they are plain text files, they can be opened by a large number of programs (such as Notepad in Windows, TextEdit in MacOS, Microsoft Excel - even Microsoft Word). While they can be opened by Microsoft Excel, they can be opened by many other programs: the csv file can be thought of as the lingua-franca of data.\nIn this demonstration, we will use data on the weight of 1000 people entered in a csv file called mod02_weight_1000.csv available on Moodle.\nTo confirm that the file is readable by any text editor, here are the first ten lines of the file, opened in Notepad on Microsoft Windows, and TextEdit on MacOS.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the read.csv function:\n\nsample &lt;- read.csv(\"data/examples/mod02_weight_1000.csv\")\n\nHere, the read.csv function has the default that the first row of the dataset contains the variable names. If your data do not have column names, you can use header=FALSE in the function.\nNote: there is an alternative function read_csv which is part of the readr package (a component of the tidyverse). Some would argue that the read_csv function is more appropriate to use because of an issue known as strings.as.factors. The strings.as.factors default was removed in R Version 4.0.0, so it is less important which of the two functions you use to import a .csv file. More information about this issue can be found here and here."

    "section": "1.23 Checking your data for errors in R",
    "text": "1.23 Checking your data for errors in R\nBefore you start describing and analysing your data, it is important to make sure that no errors have been made during the data entry process. Basically, you are looking for values that are outside the range of possible or plausible values for that variable.\nIf an error is found, the best method for correcting the error is to go back to the original data e.g. the hard copy questionnaire, to obtain the original value, entering the correct value into R If the original data is not available or the original data is also incorrect, the erroneous value is often excluded from the dataset.\nFor continuous variables, the easiest methods are to examine a boxplot and histogram. For example, a boxplot and histogram for the weight variable we just imported appear as:\n\nhist(sample$weight, xlab=\"Weight (kg)\", main=\"Histogram of 1000 weights\")\n\n\n\nboxplot(sample$weight, xlab=\"Weight (kg)\", main=\"Boxplot of 1000 weights\")\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear outlying point shown in the boxplot. Although not obvious, the same point is shown in the histogram as a bar around 700 with a very short height.\nWe can identify any outlying observations in the dataset using the subset function. You will need to decide if these values are a data entry error or are biologically plausible. If an extreme value or “outlier”, is biologically plausible, it should be included in all analyses.\nFor example, to list any observations from the sample dataset with a weight larger than 200:\n\nsubset(sample, weight&gt;200)\n\n\n\n\nid\nweight\n\n\n58\n700\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there is a very high value of 700.2kg. A value as high as 700kg is likely to be a data entry error (e.g. error in entering an extra zero) and is not a plausible weight value. Here, you should check your original data.\nYou might find that the original weight was recorded in medical records as 70.2kg. You can change this in R by writing code.\nNote: many statistical packages will allow you to view a spreadsheet version of your data and edit values in that spreadsheet. This is not best practice, as corrected observations may revert to their original values depending on whether the edited data have been saved or not. By using code-based recoding, the changes will be reproduced the next time the code is run.\nWe will use an ifelse statement to recode the incorrect weight of 700.2kg into 70.2kg. The form of the ifelse statement is as follows:\nifelse(test, value_if_true, value_if_false)\nOur code will create a new column (called weight_clean) in the sample dataframe. We will test whether weight is equal to 700.2; if this is true, we will assign weight_clean to be 70.2, otherwise weight_clean will equal the value of weight.\nPutting it all together:\n\nsample$weight_clean = ifelse(sample$weight==700.2, 70.2, sample$weight)\n\nNote: if an extreme value lies within the range of biological plausibility it should not be removed from analysis.\nOnce you have checked your data for errors, you are ready to start analysing your data.\n\n1.23.1 What on earth: == ?\nIn R, the test of equality is denoted by two equal signs: ==. So we would use == to test whether an observation is equal to a certain value. Let’s see an example:\n\n# Test whether 6 is equal to 6\n6 == 6\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Test whether 6 is equal to 42\n6 == 42\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nYou can read the == as “is equal to”. So the code sample$weight == 700.2 is read as: “is the value of weight from the data frame sample equal to 700.2?”. In our ifelse statement above, if this condition is true, we replace weight by 70.2; if it is false, we leave weight as is."

Essentially, we want to tell R to split a plot window into a matrix with nr rows and nc columns, and we fill the cells by rows (mfrow) or columns (mfcols).\nFor example, to plot four figures in a single plot, filled by rows, we use par(mfrow=c(2,2)).\nWhen we are done plotting multiple graphs, we can reset the graphics parameters by submitting par(mfrow=c(1,1)).\n\n# Set the graphics parameters to plot 2 rows and 2 columns:\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\n\n# Specify each plot separately\nhist(survey_males$bmi, xlab=\"BMI (kg/m2)\", main=\"Males\")\nhist(survey_females$bmi, xlab=\"BMI (kg/m2)\", main=\"Females\")\n\nboxplot(survey_males$bmi, ylab=\"BMI (kg/m2)\", main=\"Males\")\nboxplot(survey_females$bmi, ylab=\"BMI (kg/m2)\", main=\"Females\")\n\n\n\n# Reset graphics parameters\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))"

When undertaking a research study, taking a sample from a population is far more cost-effective and less time consuming than collecting information from the entire population. When a sample of a population is selected, summary statistics that describe the sample are used to make inferences about the total population from which the sample was drawn. These are referred to as inferential statistics.\nHowever, for the inferences about the population to be valid, a random sample of the population must be obtained. The goal of using random sampling methods is to obtain a sample that is representative of the target population. In other words, apart from random error, the information derived from the sample is expected to be much the same as the information collected from a complete population census as long as the sample is large enough."

    "text": "2.2 Sampling methods\nMethods have been designed to select participants from a population such that each person in the target population has an equal probability of being chosen. Methods that use this approach are called random sampling methods. Examples include simple random sampling and stratified random sampling.\nIn simple random sampling, every person in the population from which the sample is drawn has the same random chance of being selected into the sample. To implement this method, every person in the population is allocated an ID number and then a random sample of the ID numbers is selected. Software packages can be used to generate a list of random numbers to select the random sample.\nIn stratified sampling, the population is divided into distinct non-overlapping subgroups (strata) according to an important characteristic (e.g. age or sex) and then a random sample is selected from each of the strata. This method is used to ensure that sufficient numbers of people are sampled from each stratum and therefore each subgroup of interest is adequately represented in the sample.\nThe purpose of using random sampling is to minimise selection bias to ensure that the sample enrolled in a study is representative of the population being studied. This is important because the summary statistics that are obtained can then be regarded as valid in that they can be applied (generalised) back to the population.\nA non-representative sample might occur when random sampling is used, simply by chance. However, non-random sampling methods, such as using a study population that does not represent the whole population, will often result in a non-representative sample being selected so that the summary statistics from the sample cannot be generalised back to the population from which the participants were drawn. The effects of non-random error are much more serious than the effects of random error. Concepts such as non-random error (i.e. systematic bias), selection bias, validity and generalisability are discussed in more detail in PHCM9796: Foundations of Epidemiology."

    "section": "2.3 Standard error and precision",
    "text": "2.3 Standard error and precision\nModule 1 introduced the mean, variance and standard deviation as measures of central tendency and spread for continuous measurements from a sample or a population. As described in Module 1, we rarely have data on the entire population but we can infer information about the population (e.g. the mean weight of people in the population) based on a sample. However, a sample taken from a population is usually a small proportion of the total population. If the sample is very small, we would not expect our estimate of the population mean value to be precise. If the sample is very large, we would expect a more precise estimate of the population mean, i.e. the estimated mean value would be much closer to the true mean value in the population.\n\n2.3.1 The standard error of the mean\nA point estimate is a single best guess of the true value in the population. Instead of trying to guess the true value, it may be preferable to give a range of values in which we think the true value lies. For example, suppose we want to estimate the average weight of a population, and found a sample mean of 65 kg. Rather than saying we believe the true mean to be 65 kg, we could say we believe it is somewhere between, say, 58 kg and 72 kg.\nOften in papers, one will see something like “the mean is 70.24 \\(\\pm\\) 1.78 kg”. The value 1.78 is the standard error of the mean (sometimes shortened to S.E.M. or S.E.). The standard error of the mean measures the extent to which we expect the means from different samples to vary because of chance error in the sampling process. The standard error is a measure of precision of the point estimate. This statistic is directly proportional to the standard deviation of the variable, and inversely proportional to the size of the sample. The standard error of the mean for a continuously distributed measurement for which the SD is an accurate measure of spread is computed as follows:\n\\[ \\text{SE}(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{\\text{SD}}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] For our sample of weight data from 30 patients in Module 1:\n\\[ \\text{SE}(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{\\text{5.04}}{\\sqrt{30}} = 0.92 \\] Because the calculation uses the sample size (n) (i.e. the number of study participants) in the denominator, the SE will become smaller when the sample size becomes larger. A smaller SE indicates that the estimated mean value is more precise.\nThe standard error is an important statistic that is related to sampling variation. When a random sample of a population is selected, it is likely to differ in some characteristic compared with another random sample selected from the same population. Also, when a sample of a population is taken, the true population mean is an unknown value.\nJust as the standard deviation measures the spread of the data around the population mean, the standard error of the mean measures the spread of the sample means. Note that we do not have different samples, only one. It is a theoretical concept which enables us to conduct various other statistical analyses."

    "text": "2.5 95% confidence interval of the mean\nIn Module 2, we showed that the characteristics of a Standard Normal Distribution are that 95% of the data lie within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean (Figure 2.2). Because the central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately Normal in large enough samples, we expect that 95% of the mean values would fall within 1.96 × SE units above and below the measured mean population value.\nFor example, if we repeated the study on weight 100 times using 100 different random samples from the population and calculated the mean weight for each of the 100 samples, approximately 95% of the values for the mean weight calculated for each of the 100 samples would fall within 1.96 × SE of the population mean weight.\nThis interpretation of the SE is translated into the concept of precision as a 95% confidence interval (CI). A 95% CI is a range of values within which we have 95% confidence that the true population mean lies. If an experiment was conducted a very large number of times, and a 95%CI was calculated for each experiment, 95% of the confidence intervals would contain the true population mean.\nThe calculation of the 95% CI for a mean is as follows:\n\\[  \\bar{x} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}( \\bar{x} ) \\] This is the generic formula for calculating 95% CI for any summary statistic. In general, the mean value can be replaced by the point estimate of a rate or a proportion and the same formula applies for computing 95% CIs, i.e.\n\\[ 95\\% \\text{ CI} = \\text{point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(\\text{point estimate)} \\]\nThe main difference in the methods used to calculate the 95% CI for different point estimates is the way the SE is calculated. The methods for calculating 95% CI around proportions and other ratio measures will be discussed in Module 6.\nThe use of 1.96 as a general critical value to compute the 95% CI is determined by sampling theory. For the confidence interval of the mean, the critical value (1.96) is based on normal distribution (true when the population SD is known). However, in practice, Stata and other statistical packages will provide slightly different confidence intervals because they use a critical value obtained from the t-distribution. The t-distribution approaches a normal distribution when the sample size approaches infinity, and is close to a normal distribution when the sample size is ≥30.The critical values obtained from the t-distribution are always larger than the corresponding critical value from the normal distribution. The difference gets smaller as the sample size becomes larger. For example, when the sample size n=10, the critical value from the t-distribution is 2.26 (rather than 1.96); when n= 30, the value is 2.05; when n=100, the value is 1.98; and when n=1000, the critical value is 1.96.\nThe critical value multiplied by SE (for normal distribution, 1.96 × SE) is called the maximum likely error for 95% confidence.\n\n2.5.1 Worked Example 3.1: 95% CI of a mean\nFor our sample of weights data with standard error of 0.92:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ 95\\% \\text{ CI}(\\bar{x}) &=  \\bar{x} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(\\bar{x}) \\\\\n&= 70.0 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.92 \\\\\n&= 68.2 \\text{ to } 71.8 \\text{kg}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We interpret this confidence interval as: we are 95% confident that the true mean of the population from which our sample was drawn lies between 68.2 kg and 71.8 kg.\nThis calculation takes into account both the sample mean of 70.0 kg and the sampling error that has arisen by chance due to the sample size of 30 people.\nFor a 95% CI to be reported around a mean value, the data values need to be approximately normally distributed, as discussed in Module 2.\n\n\n2.5.2 The t-distribution and when should I use it?\nThe population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is required for calculation of the standard error. Usually, \\(\\sigma\\) is not known and the sample standard deviation (\\(s\\)) is used to estimate it. It is known, however, that the sample standard deviation of a normally distributed variable underestimates the true value of \\(\\sigma\\), particularly when the sample size is small.\nSomeone by the pseudonym of Student came up with the Student’s t distribution with (\\(n-1\\)) degrees of freedom to account for this underestimation. It looks very much like the standardised normal distribution, only that it has fatter tails (Figure 2.1). As the degrees of freedom increase (i.e. as \\(n\\) increases), the t-distribution gradually approaches the standard normal distribution. With a sufficiently large sample size, the Student’s t-distribution closely approximates the standardised normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The normal (Z) and the student’s t-distribution with 2, 5 and 30 degrees of freedom\n\n\n\n\nIf a variable \\(X\\) is normally distributed and the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is known, using the normal distribution is appropriate. However, if \\(\\sigma\\) is not known then one should use the student t-distribution with (\\(n – 1\\)) degrees of freedom.\n\n\n2.5.3 Worked Example 3.2\nThe publication of a study using a sample of 242 participants reported a sample mean systolic blood pressure of 128.4 mmHg and a sample standard deviation of 19.56 mmhg. Find the 95% confidence interval for the mean systolic blood pressure.\nIn Stata we use the cii means command to compute the 95% confidence interval given the sample mean, sample standard deviation and the sample size (i.e. without using individual data from a dataset) (Section 2.7):\n\n. cii means 242 128.4 19.56\n\n    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std.

In this module, we introduce hypothesis testing as the basis of the statistical tests that are important for reporting results from research and surveillance studies, and that you will be learning in the remainder of this course.\nWe use hypothesis testing to answer questions such as whether two groups have different health outcomes or whether there is an association between a treatment and a health outcome. For example, we may want to know:\n\nwhether a safety program has been effective in reducing injuries in a factory, i.e. whether the frequency of injuries in the group who attended a safety program is lower than in the group who did not receive the safety program;\nwhether a new drug is more effective in reducing blood pressure than a conventional drug, i.e. whether the mean blood pressure in the group receiving the new drug is lower than the mean blood pressure in the group receiving the conventional medication;\nwhether an environmental exposure increases the risk of a disease, i.e. whether the frequency of disease is higher in the group who have been exposed to an environmental factor than in the non-exposed group.\n\nWe may also want to know something about a single group. For example, whether the mean blood pressure of a sample is the same as the general population.\nThese questions can be answered by setting up a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, and performing a hypothesis test (also known as a significance test)."

    "section": "3.2 Hypothesis testing",
    "text": "3.2 Hypothesis testing\nHypothesis testing is a statistical technique that is used to quantify the evidence against a null hypothesis. A null hypothesis (H0) is a statement that there is no difference in a summary statistic between groups. For example, a null hypothesis may be stated as follows:\nH0 = there is no difference in mean systolic blood pressure between a group taking a conventional drug and a group taking a newly developed drug\nWe also have an alternative hypothesis that is opposite or contrasting to the null hypothesis. In our example above, the alternative hypothesis above we be that there is a difference between groups. The alternative hypothesis is usually of most interest to the researcher but in practice, formal statistical tests are used to test the null hypothesis (not the alternative hypothesis). The hypotheses are always in reference to the population from which the sample is drawn, not the sample itself.\nAfter setting up our null and alternative hypotheses, we use the data to generate a test statistic. The particular test statistic differs depending on the type of data being analyses (e.g. continuous or categorical), the study design (e.g. paired or independent) and the question being asked.\nThe test statistic is then compared to a known distribution to calculate the probability of observing a test statistic which is as large or larger than the observed test statistic, if the null hypothesis was true. The probability is known as the P-value. Informally, the P-value can be interpreted as the probability of observing data like ours, or more extreme, if the null hypothesis was true.\nIf the P-value is small, it is unlikely that we would observe data like ours or more extreme if the null hypothesis was true. In other words, our data are not consistent with the null hypothesis, and we conclude that we have evidence against the null hypothesis. If the P-value is not small, the probability of observing data like ours or more extreme is not unlikely. We therefore have little or no evidence against the null hypothesis. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis cannot be proven or accepted; we can only find evidence to refute the null hypothesis.\nTo summarise:\n\na small P-value gives us evidence against the null hypothesis;\na P-value that is not small provides little or no evidence against null hypothesis;\nthe smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nHistorically, a value of 0.05 has been used as a cut-point for finding evidence against the null hypothesis. A P-value less than 0.05 would be interpreted as “statistically significant”, and would allow us to “reject the null hypothesis”. A P-value greater than 0.05 would be interpreted as “not significant”, and we would “fail to reject the null hypothesis”. This arbitrary dichotomy is overly simplistic, and a more nuanced view is now recommended. Possible interpretations for P-values are given in Table 3.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Interpretation of P-values\n\n\nSize of P value\nStrength of evidence\n\n\n&lt;0.001\nVery strong evidence\n\n\n0.001 to &lt;0.01\nStrong evidence\n\n\n0.01 to &lt;0.05\nEvidence\n\n\n0.05 to &lt;0.1\nWeak evidence\n\n\n≥0.1\nLittle or no evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP-values are usually generated using statistical software although other methods such as statistical tables or Excel functions can be used to generate test statistics and determine the P-value. In traditional statistics, the probability level was described as a lower-case p but in many journals today, probability is commonly described by upper case P. Both have the same meaning."

The effect size is a summary statistic that conveys the size of the difference between two groups. For continuous variables, it is usually calculated as the difference between two mean values.\nIf the variable is binary, the effect size can be expressed as the absolute difference between two proportions (attributable risk), or as an odds ratio or relative risk.\nReporting the effect size enables clinicians and other researchers to judge whether a statistically significant result is also a clinically important finding. The size of the difference or the risk statistic provides information to help health professionals decide whether the observed effect is large and important enough to warrant a change in current health care practice, is equivocal and suggests a need for further research, or is small and clinically unimportant."

    "text": "3.4 Statistical significance and clinical importance\nWhen applying statistical methods in health and medical research, we need to make an informed decision about whether the effect size that led to a statistically significant finding is also clinically important (see Figure 3.1)). The decision about whether a statistically significant result is also clinically important depends on expert knowledge and is best made by practitioners with experience in the field.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Statistical significance vs. clinical importance (Source: Armitage P, Berry G, Matthews JNS. (2001)\n\n\nIt is possible when conducting significance tests, particularly in very large studies, that a small effect is found to be statistically significant. For example, say in a large study of over 1000 patients, a new medication was found to lower blood pressure on average by 1 mmHg more than a currently accepted drug and this was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). However, such a small decrease in blood pressure would probably not be considered clinically important. The cost and side effects of prescribing the new medication would need to be weighed against the very small average benefit that would be expected. In this case, although the null hypothesis would be rejected (i.e. the result is statistically significant), the result would not be clinically important. This is the situation described in scenario (c) of Figure Figure 3.1.\nConversely, it is possible to obtain a large, clinically important difference between groups, but a P value that does not demonstrate a statistically significant difference.\nFor example, consider a study to measure the rate of hospital admissions. We may find that 80% of children who present to the Emergency Department are admitted before an intervention is introduced compared to only 65% of children after the intervention. However, the P value may be calculated as 0.11 and is non-significant. This is because only 60 children were surveyed in each period. Here, the reduction in the admission rate by 15% represents a clinically important difference, but not statistically significant. This situation is represented in scenario (d) of Figure 3.1.\nThe important thing to remember is that statistical significance does not always correspond to clinical importance. A statistically significant result may be clinically unimportant, and a statistically non-significant results may be clinically important."

If the P-value is not small, there is little evidence against the null hypothesis and we fail to reject the null hypothesis. As discussed above, the “small” cut-point for the P-value is often taken as 0.05. We refer to this value as \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha).\nWe can conduct a thought experiment and compare our hypothesis test conclusion to reality. In reality, either the null hypothesis is true, or it is false. Of course, if we knew what reality was, we would not need to conduct a hypothesis test. But we can compare our possible hypothesis test conclusions to the true (unobserved) reality.\nIf the null hypothesis was true in reality, our hypothesis test can fail to reject the null hypothesis – this would be a correct conclusion. However, the hypothesis test could lead us to rejecting the null hypothesis – this would be an incorrect conclusion. We call this scenario a Type I error, and it has a probability of \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe other situation is where, in reality, the null hypothesis is false. A correct conclusion would be where our hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis. However, if our hypothesis test fails to reject the null hypothesis, we have made a Type II error. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted \\(\\beta\\) (beta). We will see in Module 10 that \\(\\beta\\) is determined by the size of the study.\nThe error in falsely rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (type I error), or in falsely accepting the null hypothesis when it is not true (type II error) is summarised in Table 3.2. We will return to these concepts in Module 10, when discussing how to determine the appropriate sample size of a study.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Comparison of study result with the truth\n\n\nStudy result\nTruth\n\n\n\nEffect\nNo effect\n\n\nEvidence\nCorrect conclusion\nɑ\n\n\nNo evidence\nβ\nCorrect conclusion"

    "text": "3.6 Confidence intervals in hypothesis testing\nIn Module 3, the 95% confidence interval around a mean value was calculated to show the precision of the summary statistic. The 95% confidence intervals around other summary statistics can also be calculated.\nFor example, if we were comparing the means of two groups, we would want to test the null hypothesis that the difference in means is zero, that there is no true difference between the groups.\nFrom the data from the two groups, we could estimate the difference in means, the standard error of the difference in means and the 95% confidence interval around the difference. To estimate the 95% confidence interval, we use the formula given in Module 3, that is:\n\\[ 95\\% \\text{ CI} = \\text{Difference in means} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(\\text{Difference in means)} \\]\nIt is important to remember that the 95% CI is estimated from the standard error, and that the standard error has a direct relationship to the sample size. For small sample sizes, the standard error is large and the 95% CI becomes wider. Conversely, the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error and the narrower the 95% CI becomes indicating a more precise estimate of the mean difference.\nThe 95% CI tells us the region in which we are 95% confident that the true difference between the groups in the population lies. If this region contains the null value of no difference, we can say that we are 95% confident that there is no true difference between the groups and therefore we would not reject the null hypothesis. This is shown in the top two estimates in Figure 3.2. If the zero value lies outside the 95% confidence interval, we can conclude that there is evidence of a difference between the groups because we are 95% confident that the difference does not encompass a zero value (as shown in the lower two estimates in Figure 3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Using confidence intervals as informal hypothesis tests\n\n\n\n\nFor relative risk and odds ratio measures, when the 95% CI includes the value of 1 it indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true RR or OR of the association between the study factor and outcome factor includes 1.0 in the source population. This indicates little evidence of an association between the study factor and the outcome factor, e.g. if the results of a study were reported as RR = 1.10 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.25). The P-value can be calculated to assess this (discussed in Module 7).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Values indicating no effect\n\n\nType of outcome\nMeasure of effect\nNull value\n\n\n\n\n(indicating no difference)\n\n\nContinuous\nDifference in means\n0\n\n\nBinary\nDifference in proportions\n0\n\n\nRelative risk\n1\n\n\nOdds ratio\n1"

The t-distribution and its relation to normal distribution has been discussed in detailed in Module 3.\nIn a one-sample t-test, a t-value is computed as the sample mean divided by the standard error of the mean. The significance of the t-value is then computed using software, or can be obtained from a statistical table.\nThe principles of this test can be used for applications such as testing whether the mean of a sample is different from a known population mean, for example testing whether the IQ of a group of children is different from the population mean of 100 IQ points or testing whether the number of average hours worked in an adult sample is different from the population mean of 38 hours.\n\n3.7.1 Worked Example\nThe mean diastolic blood pressure (BP) of the general US population is known to be 71 mm Hg. The diastolic blood pressure of 733 female Pima indigenous Americans was measured and a histogram showed that the data were approximately normally distributed. The mean diastolic blood pressure in the sample was 72.4 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 12.38 mm Hg.\nWe can use Stata or R to conduct a one sample t-test using the data available on Moodle (mod04_blood_pressure.csv).

Note that this interval does not contain the mean of the general US population (71 mm Hg), providing some indication that the mean diastolic blood pressure of female Pima people is higher than that of the general US population.\nThe result from the formal hypothesis test gives strong evidence that the mean diastolic BP of the female Pima people is higher than that of the general US population (t732=3.07, P=0.002)."

    "text": "3.8 One and two tailed tests\nMost statistical tests are two tailed tests, that is, we conduct a test that allows for the summary statistic in the group of interest to be either higher or lower than in the comparison group. For a t-test, this requires that we obtain a two-tailed P value which gives us the probability of the t-value being in either one of the two tails of the t-distribution as shown in Figure 3.3. The shaded regions show the t values that indicate a P value less than 0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: P-value for a 2-tailed test\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally, one tailed tests are conducted in which the summary statistic in the group of interest can only be higher or lower than the comparison group, i.e. a difference is specified to occur in one direction only. This makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis because the consequence is that the P value is essentially halved. The P value for a one tailed test would be 0.025 i.e. the shaded region for a one-tailed test would be doubled on one side of the distribution and eliminated from the other side of the distribution as shown in Figure 3.4.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: P-value for 1-tailed tests\n\n\n\n\nIf a one tailed P value is reported, and is considered to be an invalid decision, it is usually easily converted to a two tailed value by doubling its numeric value. For example, for the same test statistic and sample size:\n\nOne tailed P value = 0.042 i.e. statistically significant\nTwo tailed P value = 0.084 i.e. non-significant\n\nObviously, the choice of whether to use a one or two tailed test is not as important when the P value is highly significant or clearly non-significant but can make a difference to the conclusions when the P value is on the margins of significance.\nIn most health research, the use of a one tailed test is rarely justified because it is unusual to be certain of the direction of effect prior to the research study being undertaken. It has been suggested that if the researchers were sure enough to consider using a one-tailed test, the research study would not be needed.\nIn most studies, two tailed tests of significance are used to allow for the possibility that the effect size could occur in either direction. In clinical trials, this would mean allowing for a result that can indicate a benefit or an adverse effect in response to a new treatment. In epidemiological studies, two tailed tests are used to allow for the fact that exposure to a factor of interest may be adverse or may be beneficial. This conservative approach is usually adopted to prevent missing important effects that occur in the opposite direction to that expected by the researchers."

    "section": "4.1 Introduction",
    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nIn Module 4, a one-sample t-test was used for comparing a single mean to a hypothesised value. In health research, we often want to compare the means between two groups. For example, in an observational study, we may want to compare cholesterol levels in people who are normal weight to the levels in people who are overweight. In a clinical trial, we may want to compare cholesterol levels in people who have been randomised to a dietary modification or to usual care. In this module, we show how to compare the means of two groups where the analysis variable is normally distributed.\nFrom the decision tree presented in the Appendix, we can see that if we have a continuous outcome measure and two categorical groups that are not related, i.e. a binary exposure measurement, the test for such data is an independent samples t-test. The test is also sometimes called a 2-sample t-test.\nHowever, in research, data are often ‘paired’ or ‘matched’, that is the two data points are related to one another. This occurs when measurements are taken:\n\nFrom each participant on two occasions, e.g. at baseline and follow-up in an experimental study or in a longitudinal cohort study;\nFrom related people, e.g. a mother and daughter or a child and their sibling;\nFrom related sites in the same person, e.g. from both limbs, eyes or kidneys;\nFrom matched participants e.g. in a matched case-control study;\nIn cross-over clinical trials where the patient receives both drugs, often in random order.\n\nAn independent samples t-test cannot be used for analysing paired or matched data because the assumption that the two groups are independent is violated. Treating paired or matched measurements as independent samples would artificially inflate the sample size and lead to inaccurate P values. When the data are related in a paired or matched way and the outcome is continuous, a paired t-test is the appropriate statistic to use if the data are normally distributed."

    "section": "4.2 Independent samples t-test",
    "text": "4.2 Independent samples t-test\nAn independent samples t-test is a parametric test that is used to assess whether the mean values of two groups are different from one another. Thus, the test is used to assess whether two mean values are similar enough to have come from the same population or whether the difference between them is so large that the two groups can be considered to have come from separate populations with different characteristics.\nThe null hypothesis is that the mean values of the two groups are not different, that is:\nH0: (Mean2 - Mean1) = 0\nRejecting the null hypothesis using an independent samples t-test indicates that the difference between the means of the two groups is large in relation to the variability in the samples and is unlikely to be due to chance or to sampling variation.\n\n4.2.1 Assumptions for an independent samples t-test\nThe assumptions that must be met before an independent samples t-test can be used are:\n\nThe two groups are independent\nThe measurements are independent\nThe outcome variable must be continuous and must be normally distributed in each group\nThe variance in the two groups is similar (homogenous)\n\nThe first two assumptions are determined by the study design. The two samples must be independent, i.e. if a person is in one group then they cannot be included in the other group, and the measurements within a sample must be independent, i.e. each person must be included in their group once only.\nThe third assumption of normality is important although t-tests are robust to some degree of non-normality as long as there are no influential outliers and, more importantly, if the sample size is large. We examined how to assess normality in Module 2. If the data are not normally distributed, it may be possible to transform them using a mathematical function such as a logarithmic transformation. If not, then we may need to use non-parametric tests. This is examined in Module 9.\nThe final assumption is homogeneity of variance between the groups. This can be verified by checking that the standard deviation (square root of the variance) of each group is similar. If the variances are different, then Welch’s t-test, an alternative version of the t-test can be used.\n\n\n4.2.2 Worked Example\nIn an observational study of a random sample of 100 full term babies from the community, birth weight and gender were measured. There were 44 male babies and 56 female babies in the sample. The research question asked whether there was a difference in birth weights between boys and girls. The two groups are independent of each other and therefore an independent samples t-test can be used to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in weight between the genders.\nSome preliminary descriptive statistics of the distribution of the variable of interest in each group should always be obtained before a t-test is undertaken to ensure that the assumptions are met. Box plots and histograms are ideal for this. Histrograms and box plots of the data obtained in Stata using Graphics &gt; Box plot is shown in Figure Figure 4.1. The dataset mod05_birthweight.dta is available on Moodle.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Histograms and box plots of birth weight by gender\n\n\n\n\nThe plots show that the data are approximately normally distributed: the histograms are relatively bell shaped and symmetric, and the boxes are fairly symmetrical, there are no outliers as indicated by dots, and the spread is similar in both groups as the similar length of the whiskers suggesting that the variance is homogenous.\nWe can also describe the data using summary statistics:\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Summary of birthweight by gender\n\n\nCharacteristic\nFemale\nMale\n\n\nBirthweight\n\n\n\n\nN\n56\n44\n\n\nMean (SD)\n3.59 (0.36)\n3.42 (0.35)\n\n\nMedian (IQR)\n3.53 (3.33, 3.87)\n3.43 (3.16, 3.63)\n\n\nRange\n2.95, 4.25\n2.75, 4.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table shows that girls have a mean weight of 3.59 kg (SD 0.36) and boys have a mean weight of 3.42 kg (SD 0.35) with females being heavier than males. The variabilities of birth weight, as indicated by the standard deviations, are similar.\n\n\n4.2.3 Conducting and interpreting an independent samples t-test\nAn independent samples t-test provides us with a t statistic from which we can compute a P value. The computation of the t statistic is as follows:\n\\[t = \\frac{{\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2}}{SE({\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2})}\\]\nwith n1 + n2 – 2 degrees of freedom.\nLooking at the formula for the t-statistic, we can see that the \\(t\\) is an estimate of how different the mean values are compared to their variability. So \\(t\\) will become larger as the difference in means increases with respect to the variability.\nStatistical software will calculate both the t and P values. If the t-value is large, the P value will be small, providing evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups.\nTable 4.2 summarises the results of an independent samples t-test using mod05_birthweight.dta. The process of conducting the t-test is summarised for Stata and R in the following sections.\nPresent SD or SE??? Inconsistent between the previous two tables\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Birthweight (kg) by sex\n\n\nSex\nn\nMean (SE)\n95% Confidence Interval\n\n\nFemale\n56\n3.59 (0.049)\n3.49 to 3.68\n\n\nMale\n44\n3.42 (0.053)\n3.31 to 3.53\n\n\nDifference\n\n0.17 (0.072)\n0.02 to 0.31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see that girls are heavier than boys, and the mean difference in weights between the genders is 0.17 kg (95% CI 0.02, 0.31). We are 95% confident that the true mean difference lies between 0.02 and 0.31. Note that this interval does not contain the null value of 0.\nHere we are testing the null hypothesis of no difference in mean birthweights between females and males: a two-sided test. The t-value is calculated as 2.297 with 98 degrees of freedom, and yields a two-sided P value of 0.024, providing evidence of a difference in mean birthweight between sex."

    "text": "4.3 Paired t-tests\nIf the outcome of interest is the difference in the continuously outcome measurement between each pair of observations, a paired t-test is used. In effect, a paired t-test is used to assess whether the mean of the differences between the two related measurements is significantly different from zero. In this sense, a paired t-test is very closely aligned with a one sample t-test.\nWhen using a paired t-test, the variation between the pairs of measurements is the most important statistic. The variation between the participants is of little interest.\nFor related measurements, the data for each pair of values must be entered on the same row of the spreadsheet. Thus, the number of rows in the data sheet is the number of pairs of observations. Thus, the effective sample size is the total number of pairs and not the total number of measurements.\n\n4.3.1 Assumptions for a paired t-test\nThe assumptions for a paired t-test are:\n\nthe outcome variable is continuous\nthe differences between the pair of the measurements are normally distributed\n\nFor a paired samples t-test, it is important to test whether the differences between the two measurements are normally distributed. If the assumptions for a paired t-test cannot be met, a non-parametric equivalent is a more appropriate test to use (Module 9).\n\n\n4.3.2 Computing a paired t-test\nThe null hypothesis for using a paired t-test is as follows:\nH0: Mean (Measurement1 – Measurement2) = 0\nTo compute a t-value, the size of the mean difference between the two measurements is compared to the standard error of the paired differences, i.e.\n\\[t = \\frac{\\overline{d}}{SE(\\overline{d})}\\]\nwith n–1 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of pairs.\nBecause the standard error becomes smaller as the sample size becomes larger, the t-value increases as the sample size increases for the same mean difference.\n\n\n4.3.3 Worked Example 5.2\nA total of 107 people were recruited into a study to assess whether ankle blood pressure measured in two different sites would be the same. For each person, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured in two sites: dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior.\nThe dataset mod05_ankle_bp.xls is available on Moodle. First, we need to compute the pairwise difference between SBP measured in the two sites in Stata using the generate command. This is shown in the Stata manual at the end of this module (Checking the assumptions for a Paired t-test). The distribution of the difference between SBP measured in dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior is shown in Figure 4.2. The differences approximate a normal distribution and therefore a paired t-test can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Distribution of differences in ankle SBP between two sites of 107 participants\n\n\n\n\nThe paired t-test can be performed using statistical software, with a summary of the results presented in Table 4.3. We can see that the mean SBP is very similar in the two sites.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) measured at two sites on the ankle\n\n\nSite\nn\nMean (SE)\n95% Confidence Interval\n\n\nDorsalis pedis\n107\n116.7 (3.46)\n(109.9 to 123.6)\n\n\nTibialis posterior\n107\n118.0 (3.43)\n(111.2 to 124.8)\n\n\nDifference\n107\n-1.3 (1.31)\n(-3.9 to 1.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe t-value is calculated as −0.96 with 106 degrees of freedom, providing a two-sided P-value of 0.34. Thus these data provide no evidence of a difference in systolic blood pressure between the two sites."

While RStudio allows browsing a data set as a spreadsheet, it will not let a user replace an observation with a missing value: this should be done using code.\nA missing value in R is denoted NA, and this is consistent for any variable type: continuous, string (i.e. character) and even a factor.\nRecall the weights data used in Module 2.

    "section": "5.2 Calculating proportions and 95% confidence intervals",
    "text": "5.2 Calculating proportions and 95% confidence intervals\n\n5.2.1 Calculating a proportion\nWe need two pieces of information to calculate a proportion: \\(n\\), the number of trials, and \\(k\\), the number of ‘successes’. Note that we use the term ‘success’ to describe the outcome of interest, recognising that a success may be a adverse outcome such as death or disease.\nThe following formula is used to calculate the proportion, \\(p\\):\n\\[ p = k / n \\]\nThe proportion, \\(p\\), is a number that lies between 0 and 1. Proportions and their confidence intervals can easily be converted to percentages by multiplying by 100 once computed.\nAs for all summary statistics, it is useful to compute the precision of the estimate as a 95% confidence interval (CI) to indicate the range of values in which are 95% confident that the true population value lies. In this module, we present two methods for computing a 95% confidence interval around a proportion.\n\n\n5.2.2 Calculating the 95% confidence interval of a proportion (Wald method)\nThe Wald method for calculating the 95% confidence interval is based on assuming that the proportion, \\(p\\), is Normally distributed. This assumption is reasonable if the sample is sufficiently large (for example, if \\(n&gt;30\\)) and if \\(n \\times (1-p)\\) and \\(n \\times p\\) are both larger than 5.\nThe Wald method for calculating a 95% confidence interval is given by:\n\\[\\text{95\\% CI} = p \\pm (1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(p))\\]\nwhere the standard error of a proportion is computed as:\n\\[\\text{SE}(p) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p \\times (1 - p)}{n}}\\]\n\n\n5.2.3 Worked Example\nIn a cross-sectional study of children living in a rural village, 47 children from a random sample of 215 children were found to have scabies. Here \\(n=215\\) and \\(k=47\\), so the proportion of children with scabies is estimated as:\n\\[ p = \\frac{47}{215} = 0.2186 \\]\nGiven the large sample size and the number of children with the rarer outcome is larger than 5, the Wald method is used to calculate the standard error of the proportion as:\n\\[{\\text{SE}\\left( p \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2186 \\times (1 - 0.2186)}{215}}\n}{= 0.02819}\\]\nThen, the 95% confidence interval is estimated as:\n\\[\\text{95\\% CI} = 0.2816 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.02819\\]\n\\[= 0.1634 \\text{ to } 0.2739\\]\nThe prevalence of scabies among children in the village is 21.9% (95% CI 16.3%, 27.4%). These values tell us that we are 95% confident that the true prevalence of scabies among children in the village is between 16.3% and 27.4%.\n\n\n5.2.4 Calculating the 95% confidence interval of a proportion (Wilson method)\nAnother method to calculate the confidence interval of a proportion is the Wilson (sometimes also called the ‘score’) method. We can use it in situations where it is not appropriate to use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution as described above i.e. if the sample size is small (\\(n &lt; 30\\)) or the number of subjects with the rarer outcome is 5 or fewer. This method much more difficult to implement by hand than the standard confidence interval, and so we will not discuss the hand calculation using the mathematical equation in this course. Instead, we use statistical software to do this.\nWhen using software, our worked example provides a 95% confidence interval of the prevalence of scabies of 16.9% to 27.9%.\n\n\n5.2.5 Wald vs Wilson methods\nWe have presented two methods for calculating the 95% confidence interval for a proportion. The Wald method, which assumes that the underlying proportion follows a Normal distribution, is easy to calculate and follows the form of other confidence intervals. The Wilson method, which is difficult to calculate by hand, has nicer mathematical properties. There are also a number of other methods for calculating confidence intervals for proportions, but we do not discuss these in this course.\nA paper by Brown, Cai and DasGupta (Brown, Cai, and DasGupta (2001)) has compared the properties of the Wald and Wilson methods (among others) and concluded that the Wilson method is preferred over the Wald method."

The significance test will provide a P value to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis, while the 95% confidence interval will provide the range in which we are 95% confident that the true proportion lies.\nFor example, we can test the following null hypothesis:\nH0: sample proportion is not different from the hypothesised proportion\nMuch like constructing a 95% confidence interval, there are two main options when performing a hypothesis test on a single proportion: the first assumes that the proportion follows a Normal distribution, while the second relaxes this assumption.\n\n5.3.1 z-test for testing one sample proportion\nThe first step in the z-test is to calculate a z-statistic, which is then used to calculate a P-value. The z-statistic is calculated as the difference between the population proportion and the sample proportion divided by the standard error of the population proportion, i.e.\n\\[\nz = \\frac{(p_{population} - p_{sample})}{\\text{SE}(p_{population})}\n\\]\nThis z-statistic is then compared to the standard Normal distribution to calculate the P-value.\n\n\n5.3.2 Worked Example\nA national census in a country shows that 20% of the population are smokers. A survey of a community within the country that has received a public health anti-smoking intervention shows that 54 of 300 people sampled are smokers (18%). We can calculate a 95% confidence interval around this proportion using the Wilson method, which is calculated as 14.1% to 22.7%.\nThe researchers are interested in whether the proportion of smoking in this community is the same as the population prevalence of smoking of 20%. The null hypothesis can be written as: H0: the proportion of smokers in the community is 20% (the same as in the national census).\nWe can test this by calculating a z-statistic:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nz &= \\frac{(0.18 - 0.20)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.20 × (1 - 0.20)}{300}}} \\\\\n&= -0.87\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis z-statistic does not meet or exceed the critical value of 1.96 for a two tailed test. This indicates that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference between the proportion of smokers in the community and the country. This is consistent with our 95%% confidence interval which crosses the null value of 20%.\nThe P-value for the test above can be obtained from a Normal distribution table as \\(P = 2 × 0.192 = 0.38\\) (using Table A2.1 in the Appendix), or using the hand-calculator in Stata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Binomial test for testing one sample proportion\nWe can use the binomial distribution to obtain an exact P-value for testing a single proportion. Historically, this was a time consuming process with much hand calculation. These days, Stata and other statistical software performs the calculations quickly and efficiently, and is the preferred method.\n\n\n5.3.4 Worked example\nThe file mod06_smoking_status.csv contains the data for this example. In the data file, smokers are coded as 1 and non-smokers are coded as 0.\nIn Stata, we can use the prtest command to perform a z-test, or the bitest command to perform the exact binomial test. In R, we can use the prop.test function to perform a z-test, or the binom.test function to perform the exact binomial test.\nThe z-test provides a two-sided P-value of 0.39, while the binomial test gives a two-sided P-value of 0.43. Both tests provide little evidence against the hypothesis that the prevalence of smoking in the community is 20%."

The traditional form of a 2-by-2 contigency table is given in ?tbl-2-by-2-trad.\nNote for Stata users: It is important to note that Stata presents the exposure or intervention (present, absent) in the columns and the outcome or disease (present, absent) in the rows (e.g. Table 5.1). This is opposite to the way most epidemiological tables are presented, with exposure in rows and outcome in columns. Care must be taken when reading 2-by-2 tables generated from Stata.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Stata format for presenting a contingency table\n\n\n\nExposure present\nExposure absent\nTotal\n\n\nOutcome present\na\nc\na+c\n\n\nOutcome absent\nb\nd\nb+d\n\n\nTotal\na+b\nc+d\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using a statistics program such, it is recommended that the outcome and exposure variables are coded by assigning ‘absent’ as 0 and ‘present’ as 1, for example ‘No’ = 0 and ‘Yes’ = 1. This is needed for some of the commands to work (e.g. the epidemiology table commands). This coding ensures that measures of association, such as the odds ratio or relative risk, are computed correctly by Stata."

    "text": "5.5 A brief summary of epidemiological study types\nIn this section, we wil present a very brief summary of three study types commonly used in population health research. This topic is covered in much more detail in PHCM9794: Foundations of Epidemiology, and more detail can be found in Chapter 4 of Essential Epidemiology (3rd or 4th edition) Webb, Bain and Page (Webb, Bain, and Page (2016)).\n\n5.5.1 Randomised controlled trial\nA randomised controlled trial addresses the research question: what is the effect of an intervention on an outcome. In the simplest form of a randomised controlled trial, a group of participants is randomly allocated to a group that receives the treatment of interest or to a control group that does not receive the treatment of interest. Participants are followed up over time, and the outcome is measured at the conclusion of the study.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design of a randomised controlled trial [Figure 4.1, Essential Epidemiology]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Cohort study\nA cohort study is an observational study that addresses the research question: what is the effect of an exposure on an outcome. This research question is similar to that studied in a randomised controlled trial, but the exposure is defined by the participants’ circumstances, and not manipulated by the researchers. In a cohort study, participants without the outcome of interest are enrolled, followed over time, and information on their exposure to a factor is measured (either at baseline or over time). At the conclusion of the study, information on the outcome is measured to identify new (incident) cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design of a cohort study [Figure 4.2, Essential Epidemiology]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Case control study\nWhile the randomised controlled trial and cohort study begin with a population without the outcome, a case-control study begins by assembling a group with the outcome of interest (cases), and a group without the outcome of interest (controls). The researchers then ask the cases and controls about their previous exposures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design of a case-control trial [Figure 4.3, Essential Epidemiology]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.4 Cross-sectional study\nIn a cross-sectional study, the exposure and the outcome are measured at the same time. While this results in a study that is relatively quick to conduct, it does not allow for any temporal relationships to be assessed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design of a cross-sectional study [Figure 4.4, Essential Epidemiology]"

    "text": "5.6 Measures of effect for epidemiological studies\nWe can calculate a relative measure of association between an exposure and an outcome as either a relative risk or odds ratio. The relative risk is a direct comparison of the risk in the exposed group with the risk in the non-exposed group, and can only be calculated for a cohort study (including a randomised controlled trial) or a cross-sectional study (where it is also called a prevalence ratio).\nFor cohort studies, randomised controlled trials and cross-section studies, we can calculate an absolute measure of association between an exposure and an outcome as a difference in proportions (also known as an attributable risk).\nFor case-control studies, as we sample participants based on their outcome, we can not estimate the risk of the outcome. Hence, calculating a relative risk or risk difference is inappropriate. Instead of calculating risks in a case-control study, we instead calculate odds, where the odds of an event are calculated as the number with the event divided by the number without the event.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Contingency table for a case-control study\n\n\n\nCases\nControls\nTotal\n\n\nExposure present\na\nb\na+b\n\n\nExposure absent\nc\nd\nc+d\n\n\nTotal\na+c\nb+d\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example in Table Table 5.2, we can calculate the odds of being exposed in the cases as \\(a \\div c\\). Similarly, we can calculate the odds of being exposed in the controls as \\(b \\div d\\). We can the calculate the odds ratio as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Odds ratio} &= (a \\div c) \\div (b \\div d) \\\\\n&= \\frac{a \\times d}{b \\times c} \\\\\n&= \\frac{ad}{bc}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that some authors say we should think of the odds ratio being based on the odds of being a case in the exposed group compared to the odds of being a case in the unexposed group. Here, the exposed group comprises cells “a” and “b”, so the odds of being a case in the exposed group is (a/b). Similarly, for the unexposed group, the odds of being exposed is (c/d). So our odds ratio becomes (a/b) / (c/d). If we rearrange this, we get the same odds ratio as above: (ad)/(bc).\nThe interpretation of an odds ratio is discussed in detail in PHCM9794: Foundations of Epidemiology, and an excerpt is presented here: The meaning of the calculated odds ratio as a measure of association between exposure and outcome is the same as for the rate ratio (relative risk) where:\n\nAn odds ratio &gt;1 indicates that exposure is positively associated with disease (i.e. the exposure may be a cause of disease);\nAn odds ratio &lt; 1 indicates that exposure is negatively associated with disease (i.e. the exposure may be protective against disease); and\nAn odds ratio = 1 indicates no association between the exposure and the outcome.\n\nIn some situations, related to how well controls are recruited into this study, the odds ratio is a close approximation of the relative risk. Therefore, you may see in some published papers of case control studies the OR interpreted as you would interpret a RR. This should be avoided in this course.\n\n5.6.1 Worked Example\nA randomised controlled trial was conducted among a group of patients to estimate the side effects of a drug. Fifty patients were randomly allocated to receive the active drug and 50 patients were allocated to receive a placebo drug. The outcome measured was the experience of nausea. The data is given in the file mod06_nausea.dta.csv.\nA summary table can be constructed as in Table 5.3.\n\ntibble::tribble(\n      ~` `, ~Nausea, ~`No nausea`, ~Total,\n  \"Active drug\",     15L,        35L,    50L,\n      \"Placebo\",      4L,        46L,    50L,\n        \"Total\",     19L,        81L,   100L\n  ) |&gt; \n  huxtable() |&gt;\n  theme_article() |&gt; \n  set_width(0.8)\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: Nausea status by drug exposure\n\n\n\nNausea\nNo nausea\nTotal\n\n\nActive drug\n15\n35\n50\n\n\nPlacebo\n4\n46\n50\n\n\nTotal\n19\n81\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use Stata or R to calculate the relative risk (RR=3.75) and its 95% confidence interval (1.34, 10.51). This tells us that nausea is 3.75 times more likely to occur in the active drug group compared with the placebo group. Because this is a randomised controlled trial, the relative risk would be an appropriate measure of association.\nWe can confirm the estimated relative risk:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{RR} &= \\frac{a / (a+b)}{c / (c+d)} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{15 / (15+35)}{4 / (4+46)} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{0.3}{0.08} \\\\\n  &= 3.75\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n5.6.2 Worked Example 6.5\nA case-control study investigated the association between human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer (D'Souza, et al. NEJM 2007), and the results appear in Table 5.4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.4: Association between human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer\n\n\n\nCases\nControls\nTotal\n\n\n\n(Oropharyngeal cancer)\n(No oropharyngeal cancer)\n\n\n\nHPV Positive\n57\n14\n71\n\n\nHPV Negative\n43\n186\n229\n\n\nTotal\n100\n200\n300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe odds ratio is the odds of being HPV positive in cases (those with oropharyngeal cancer) compared to the odds of being HPV positive in the controls (those without oropharyngeal cancer):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{OR} &= \\frac{a / c}{b /d} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{57 / 43}{14 / 186} \\\\\n  &= 17.6\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can use Stata or R to estimate the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. We should use the Cornfield option in Stata to provide a better estimate of the 95% confidence interval. It appears that the jmv package in R does not use the Cornfield approximation to estimate the 95% confidence interval, but uses the Woolf method.\nThe odds ratio is estimated as 17.6, and its 95% confidence interval is estimated 9.0 to 34.3 (Cornfield, using Stata) or 9.0 to 34.5 (Woolf, using R).\nRisk statistics are usually only reported with one or two decimal places. The interpretation of the confidence intervals for both the relative risk and the odds ratio is the same as for the confidence intervals around other summary measures in that it shows the region in which we are 95% confident that the true population estimate lies."

Notice the order in which the factor levels are presented: group has the Placebo level defined as the first level, and the Active level defined as the second; side_effect has No nausea defined as the first level, and the Nausea level defined as the second.\nWe will use jmv to calculate relative risks, odds ratios and risk differences. To calculate these estimates correctly, we must define the positive exposure and positive outcome to be the first level of a factor. When defining an exposure for example, we should define the active treatment or the positive exposure as the first category. When defining an outcome, we should define the category of interest (e.g. disease, or side effect) as the first category.\nIn this example, we will define Active as the first level in the group factor, and Nausea to be the first level of the side_effect factor.\nWe can do this using the relevel() function, which re-orders the levels of a factor so that the level specified is defined as the first level, and the others are moved down:\n\n# Define \"Active\" as the first level of group:\ndrug$group &lt;- relevel(drug$group, ref=\"Active\")\n\n\n# Define \"Nausea\" as the first level of side_effect:\ndrug$side_effect &lt;- relevel(drug$side_effect, ref=\"Nausea\")\n\nUpon re-leveling the factors, we can check that the levels of interest have been defined as the first levels:\n\nsummary(drug)\n\n     group       side_effect\n Active :50   Nausea   :19  \n Placebo:50   No nausea:81  \n\n\nTo construct the 2-by-2 table and calculate a relative risk, we use the contTables() function in jmv.

Here we must define the levels in the order we want the categories to appear in the table. Note that as group and side_effect are entered as text variables, we can omit labels command when defining the factors, and the factor will be labelled using the text entry:\n\ndrug_aggregated$group &lt;- factor(drug_aggregated$group, levels=c(\"Active\", \"Placebo\"))\ndrug_aggregated$side_effect &lt;- factor(drug_aggregated$side_effect, levels=c(\"Nausea\", \"No nausea\"))\n\nWe can calculate the relative risk using the summarised data in the same was done previously.

The P-value obtained from a chi-squared test gives the probability of obtaining the observed association (or more extreme) if there is in fact no association between the exposure and outcome.\nIn this Module, we also include tests for a difference in proportion for paired data.\n\n6.1.1 Worked Example\nWe are using the randomised controlled trial as given in Worked Example 6.4 on the nauseating side effect of a drug.\nThe research question is whether the active drug resulted in a different rate of nausea than the placebo drug. This is equivalent to testing whether there is an association between nausea and type of drug received (active or placebo). Thus, we will test the null hypothesis that the experience of nausea and the treatment are not related to one another. The null hypothesis is:\n\nH0: The proportion with nausea in the active drug group is the same as the proportion with nausea in the placebo drug group.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis can be stated as:\n\nHa: The proportion with nausea in the active drug group is different to the proportion with nausea in the placebo drug group."

The row and column totals are used to calculate expected counts in each cell of the contingency table as follows:\nExpected count = (Row count × Column count) / Total count\nStata will do this for us, as described in the Stata Notes section in this Module.\nA chi-squared value is then calculated to compare the expected counts (E) in each cell with the observed (actual) cell counts (O). The calculation is as follows:\n\\(\\chi ^ 2 = \\sum \\frac{(O - E)}{E} ^2\\)\nWith [Number of rows \\(-\\) 1] \\(\\times\\) [Number of columns \\(-\\) 1] degrees of freedom.\nAs for many statistics, the deviations between the observed and expected values are squared to prevent the negative and positive values balancing one another out.\nIf the expected counts are close to the observed counts, the chi-squared statistic will be close to zero, and the P-value will be close to 1. The larger the difference between the observed and expected counts, the larger the chi-squared statistic becomes (and the smaller the P-value). A large chi-squared statistic provides more evidence of an association between the exposure and outcome.\nA chi-squared test to examine whether two independent proportions are associated can be obtained in Stata using the Tables for Epidemiologists: cc and cs commands. The test can also be conducted using the tab2 command, with the advantage that the tab2 command shows the expected counts. We will show why this is important shortly.\nThe Stata output for Worked Example 7.1 for the study on nausea is shown in Output 7.1a. It is always important to request the percentages using the options in ‘Cells’ to show the proportion of patients who have the outcome in each exposure group, i.e. the row percents.\n\n\nTable 6.1: Nausea side-effect data\n\n\n\n\n(a) Observed counts\n\n\n\nNausea\nNo nausea\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nActive\n35 (70%)\n15 (30%)\n50 (100%)\n\n\nPlacebo\n46 (92%)\n4 (8%)\n50 (100%)\n\n\nTotal\n81 (81%)\n19 (19%)\n100 (100%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Expected counts\n\n\n\nNausea\nNo nausea\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nActive\n40.5\n9.5\n50\n\n\nPlacebo\n40.5\n9.5\n50\n\n\nTotal\n81\n19\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the row percentages that 8% of patients in the placebo group experienced nausea compared to 30% of patients in the active group. If no association existed, we would expect to find approximately the same percent of patients with nausea in each group. The ‘Expected’ counts are higher for the groups with ‘No nausea’ because ‘No nausea’ is more prevalent in the sample than ‘Nausea’.\nWhile the tab2 command will perform the chi-square test, the measure of effect is best obtained using the cs or cc commands, as discussed in Module 6. Using the relative risk obtained from Module 6, a conclusion from the above test can be written as:\nThe proportion with nausea in those who received the active drug is 30%, compared to 8% in those who received the placebo drug. Nausea was more frequent in those who received the active drug (Relative Risk = 3.75, 95% CI: 1.34 to 10.51). There is strong evidence that the proportion with nausea differs between the two groups (\\(\\chi ^2\\) = 7.86 with 1 df, P=0.005).\n\n6.2.1 Assumptions for using a Pearson’s chi-squared test\nThe assumptions that must be met when using Pearson’s chi-squared test are that:\n\neach observation must be independent;\neach participant is represented in the table once only;\nat least 80% of the expected cell counts should exceed a value of five;\nall expected cell counts should exceed a value of one.\n\nThe first two assumptions are dictated by the study design. The last two assumptions relate to the numbers in the cells and can be explored when running the test. There should not be too many cells with low expected counts. Sometimes, the only way to avoid small cell counts is to recruit a much larger sample size. If small cell counts cannot be avoided, Fisher’s exact test can be used instead. More information on Fisher’s exact test can be found in Chapter 13 of An Introduction to Medical Statistics, Bland (2015).\n\n\n6.2.2 Interpreting chi-squared tests\nFor the data being considered from Worked Example 7.1 all cells have an expected count greater than 5 and that the minimum cell count is 9.5. Therefore, it is appropriate to use the Pearson’s Chi-Squared test. If one or more cells have an expected cell count less than 5, then the Fisher’s exact test should be used. The P value associated with the Pearson’s chi-squared test is 0.005 indicating that we can reject the null hypothesis at a 5% level of significance. Thus, we can conclude that there is strong evidence that more patients who were randomised to receive the active treatment experienced nausea than patients randomised to the control (placebo) group."

We can test the hypothesis that the severity of allergy is not different between males and females.

This statistic is a form of chi-square applied to a paired situation. A Pearson’s chi-squared test cannot be used because the measurements are not independent. However, McNemar’s test can be used to assess whether there is a significant change in proportions between two time points or between two conditions, or whether there is a significant difference in proportions between matched cases and controls.\nFor McNemar’s test, the data are displayed as shown in Table 7.1. Cells ‘a’ and ‘d’ called concordant cells because the response was the same at both baseline and follow-up or between matched cases and controls. Cells ‘b’ and ‘c’ are called discordant cells because the responses between the pairs were different. For a follow-up study, the participants in cell ‘c’ had a positive response at baseline and a negative response at follow-up. Conversely, the participants in cell ‘b’ had a negative response at baseline and a positive response at follow-up.\nFor other types of paired data such as twins or matched cases and controls, the data are similarly displayed with the responses of one of the pairs in the columns and the responses for the other of the pairs in the rows. For paired data, the grand total ‘N’ is always the number of pairs and not the total number of participants.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.3: Table layout for testing matched proportions\n\n\n\nNegative at follow-up\nPositive at follow-up\nTotal\n\n\nNegative at baseline\na\nb\na + b\n\n\nPositive at baseline\nc\nd\nc + d\n\n\nTotal\na + c\nb + d\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.1 Worked Example 7.3\nTwo drugs labelled A and B have been administered to patients in random order so that each patient acts as their own control.

The null hypothesis is as follows:\n\nH0: The proportion of patients who do better on drug A is the same as the proportion of patients who do better on drug B\n\nCounts and overall percentages are presented in . From the “Total” row in the table, we can see that the number of patients who respond to drug A is 41 (68%) and from the “Total” column the number who respond to drug B is less at 35 (58%), that is there is a difference of 10%.\n\nPaired data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse to Drug B\nNo response to Drug B\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nResponse to Drug A\n21 (35%)\n20 (33%)\n41 (68%)\n\n\nNo response to Drug A\n14 (23%)\n5 (8%)\n19 (32%)\n\n\nTotal\n35 (58%)\n25 (42%)\n60 (100%)\n\n\n\nThe difference in the paired proportions is calculated using the simple equation:\n\\[ p_{A} - p_{B} = \\frac{(b - c)}{N} \\]\nHere, \\(p_{A} - p_{B} = \\frac{(20 - 14)}{60} = 0.1\\)\nThe cell counts show that 20 patients responded to Drug A but not to drug B, and 14 patients responded to Drug B but not to drug A. McNemar’s statistic is computed from these two discordant pairs (labelled as ‘b’ and ‘c’) as follows:\n\\[ X^2 = \\frac{(b-c)^2}{b+c} \\]\nwith 1 degree of freedom. Using our worked example, the McNemar’s chi-squared statistic is calculated as 1.06 with 1 degree of freedom, giving a P-value of 0.3.\nAs described above, the difference in proportions can be calculated. A 95% confidence interval for this difference can be obtained using statistical software.\nIn this study of 60 participants, where each participant received both drugs, 41 (68%) responded to Drug A and 35 (58%) responded to Drug B. The difference in the proportions responding is estimated as 10% (95% CI -11% to 31%). There is no evidence that the response differed between the two drugs (McNemar’s chi-square=1.06 with 1 degree of freedom, P=0.3).\nADD TEXT AROUND THE EXACT TEST BEING BASED ON BINOMIAL TEST KIRKWOOD RECOMMENDS B+C TO BE BIGGER THAN 10, OTHERWISE USE EXACT BINOMIAL TEST"

    "text": "7.1 Introduction\nIn Module 5, we saw how to test whether the means from two groups are equal - in other words, whether a continuous variable is related to a categorical variable. We often want to know how closely two continuous variables are related. For example, we may want to know how closely blood cholesterol levels are related to dietary fat intake in adult men. To measure the strength of association between two continuously distributed variables, a correlation coefficient is used.\nWe may also want to know how well one continuous measurement predicts the value of another continuous measurement. For example, we may want to know how well height predicts values of lung capacity in a community of adults. A regression model allows us to use one measurement to predict another measurement.\nAlthough both correlation coefficients and regression models can be used to describe the degree of association between two continuous variables, the two methods provide very different statistical information. It is important to note that both methods only measures the strengths of an association between variables and does not imply a causal relationship."

    "text": "7.2 Correlation\nWe use correlation to measure the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. Before calculating a correlation coefficient, a scatter plot should first be obtained to give an understanding of the nature of the relationship between the two variables.\n\n7.2.1 Worked Example\nThe file mod08_lung_function.csv has information about height and lung function collected from a sample of 120 adults. A random sample of adults was approached to take part in the research study, but the response rate was low at 45%. Information was collected on height (cm) and lung function, which was measured as forced vital capacity (FVC). We can obtain a scatter-plot shown in Figure 7.1. This shows that as height increases, lung function also increases, which is as expected. One or two of the data points are separated from the rest of the data but are not so far away as to be considered outliers because they do not seem to stand out of other observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Correlation coefficients\nA correlation coefficient (r) describes how closely the variables are related, that is the strength of linear association between two continuous variables. The range of the coefficient is from +1 to −1 where +1 is a perfect positive association, 0 is no association and −1 is a perfect inverse association. In general, an absolute (disregarding the sign) r value below 0.3 indicates a weak association, 0.3 to &lt; 0.6 is fair association, 0.6 to &lt; 0.8 is a moderate association, and \\(\\ge\\) 0.8 indicates a strong association.\nThe coefficient is positive when large values of one variable tend to occur with large values of the other, and small values of one variable (y) tend to occur with small values of the other (x) (Figure 7.2 (a and b)). For example, height and weight in healthy children or age and blood pressure.\nThe coefficient is negative when large values of one variable tend to occur with small values of the other, and small values of one variable tend to occur with large values of the other (Figure 7.2 (c and d)). For example, percentage immunised against infectious diseases and under-five mortality rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Scatter plots demonstrating strong and weak, positive and negative associations\n\n\n\n\nThe P value associated with an r value is an estimate of whether the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero. However, a correlation coefficient that does not have a significant P value does not imply that there is no relationship because the correlation coefficient only tests for a linear association and there may be a non-linear relationship such as a curved or irregular relationship.\nThe assumptions for using a Pearson’s correlation coefficient are that:\n\nobservations are independent;\nboth variables are continuous variables;\nthe relationship between the two variables is linear.\n\nThere is a further assumption that the data follow a bivariate normal distribution. This assumes: y follows a normal distribution for given values of x; and x follows a normal distribution for given values of y. This is quite a technical assumption that we do not discuss further.\nThere are two types of correlation coefficients– the correct one to use is determined by the nature of the variables as shown in Table 7.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: Correlation coefficients and their application\n\n\nCorrelation coefficient\nApplication\n\n\nPearson’s correlation coefficient: r\nBoth variables are continuous and a bivariate normal distribution can be assumed\n\n\nSpearman’s rank correlation: rho\nBivariate normality cannot be assumed. Also useful when at least one of the variables is ordinal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpearman’s \\(\\rho\\) is calculated using the ranks of the data, rather than the actual values of the data. We will see further examples of such methods in Module 9, when we consider non-parametric tests, which are often based on ranks.\nCorrelation coefficients are often presented in the form of a correlation matrix which can display the correlation between a number of variables in a single table (Table 7.2).\n\n\nTable 7.2: Correlation matrix for Height and FVC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight\nFVC\n\n\nHeight\n1\n0.70\nP &lt; 0.0001\n\n\nFVC\n0.70\nP &lt; 0.0001\n1\n\n\n\n\nThis correlation matrix shows that the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between height and lung function is 0.70 with P&lt;0.0001 indicating very strong evidence of a linear association between height and FVC. A correlation matrix sometimes includes correlations between the same variable, indicated as a correlation coefficient of 1. For example, \\(Height\\) is perfectly correlated with itself (i.e. has a correlation coefficient of 1). Similarly, \\(FVC\\) is perfectly correlated with itself.\nThis r value was calculated for the full data set of 120 adults who had heights ranging from 160 to 172cms. If the r value is calculated for the 60 adults with a height less than 165cms, it is much lower at 0.433 although significant at P=0.001. In general, r values are higher for a wider range of values on the x axis even though the relationship between the two variables remains the same.\nCorrelation coefficients are rarely used as important statistics in their own right because they do not fully explain the relationship between the two variables and the range of the data has an important influence on the size of the coefficient. In addition, the statistical significance of the correlation coefficient is often over interpreted because a small correlation which is of no clinical importance can become statistically significant even with a relatively small sample size. For example, a poor correlation of 0.3 will be statistically significant if the sample size is large enough."

    "text": "7.3 Linear regression\nThe nature of a relationship between two variables is more fully described using regression. There are two principal purposes for building a regression model. The most common is to build a predictive model, for example in situations in which age and gender are used to predict normal values of characteristics such as lung size or body mass index. Normal values are the range of values that occur naturally in the general population.\nThe second purpose for using a regression model is for testing the hypothesis that there is a linear relationship between one or more explanatory variables and an outcome variable. For example, a regression model can be used to test the extent to which age predicts BMI or to test the hypothesis that two groups with a different dietary regime have significantly different BMI values after adjusting for age differences.\nFrom Worked Example 8.1, we can be also plot a regression line through the scatter. Figure @ref(fig:scatter-plot-line) shows the data overlayed with the fitted regression line.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociation between height and lung function in 120 adults\n\n\n\n\nThe line through the plot is called the line of ‘best fit’ because the size of the deviations between the data points and the line is minimised in the calculation. The distance between each data point and the regression line is called a ‘residual’.\n\n7.3.1 Regression equations\nThe mathematical equation for the line explains the relationship between the two variables. The equation of the regression line is as follows:\n\\[y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x\\]\nThis line is shown in Figure 7.3 using the notation shown in Table 7.3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Coefficients of a linear regression equation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.3: Notation for linear regression equation\n\n\nSymbol\nInterpretation\n\n\n\\(y \\)\nObserved value of the outcome variable\n\n\n\\(x \\)\nObserved value of the explanatory variable\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\)\nIntercept of the regression line\n\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\)\nSlope of the regression line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intercept is the point at which the regression line intersects with the y-axis when the value of ‘x’ is zero. In most cases, the intercept does not have a biologically meaningful interpretation as the explanatory variable cannot take a value of zero. In our working example, the intercept is not meaningful as it is not possible for an adult to have a height of 0cm.\nThe slope of the line is the predicted change in the outcome variable ‘y’ as the explanatory explanatory variable ‘x’ increases by 1 unit.\nAn important concept is that regression predicts an expected value of ‘y’ given an observed value of ‘x’: any error around the explanatory variable is not taken into account. For this reason, measurements that can be taken accurately, such as age and height, make good explanatory variables."

One way of assessing the model fit is to compute a statistic called coefficient of determination, denoted by \\(R^2\\). It is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient \\(r: r^2 = R^2\\). Since the range of \\(r\\) is from −1 to 1, \\(R^2\\) must lie between 0 and 1.\n\\(R^2\\) can be interpreted as the proportion of variability in y that can be explained by variability in x. Hence, the following conditions may arise:\nIf \\(R^2 = 1\\), then all variation in y can be explained by variation of x and all data points fall on the regression line.\nIf \\(R^2 = 0\\), then none of the variation in y is related to x at all, and the variable x explains none of the variability in y.\nIf \\(0 &lt; R^2 &lt;1\\), then the variability of y can be partially explained by the variability in x. The larger the \\(R^2\\) value, the better is the fit of the regression model.\n\n\n7.5.2 Assumptions for linear regression\nRegression is robust to moderate degrees of non-normality in the variables, provided that the sample size is large enough and that there are no influential outliers. Also, the regression equation describes the relationship between the variables and this is not influenced as much by the spread of the data as the correlation coefficient is.\nThe assumptions that must be met when using linear regression are as follows:\n\nobservations are independent;\nthe relationship between the explanatory and the outcome variable is linear;\nthe residuals are normally distributed.\n\nA residual is defined as the difference between the observed and predicted outcome from the regression model. If the predicted value of the outcome variable is denoted by \\(\\hat y\\) then:\n\\[ \\text{Residual} = \\text{observed} - \\text{predicted} = y - \\hat y\\]\nIt is important for regression modelling that the data are collected in a period when the relationship remains constant. For example, in building a model to predict normal values for lung function the data must be collected when the participants have been resting and not exercising and people taking bronchodilator medications that influence lung capacity should be excluded. In regression, it is not so important that the variables themselves are normally distributed, but it is important that the residuals are. Scatter plots and specific diagnostic tests can be used to check the regression assumptions. Some of these will not be covered in this introductory course but will be discussed in detail in the Regression Methods in Biostatistics course.\nThe distribution of the residuals should always be checked. Large residuals can indicate unusual points or points that may exert undue influence on the estimated regression slope.\nThe histogram of residuals from the model is shown in Figure 7.4. The residuals are approximately normally distributed, with no outlying values.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Histogram of regression residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.3 Critical appraisal\nWhen reading the literature, it is important to be critical about how correlation coefficients are interpreted. It is a good idea to check if a scatter plot is shown to help interpret the relationship and to indicate if there are any potential outliers. Also, question whether the correlation coefficient has been calculated from a random sample and if not, what selected samples the value can be generalised to.\nWhen regression is reported it is essential that the axes are correctly presented so that the equation is predictive. Thus, the explanatory variable must be presented on the x axis and the outcome on the y axis. It is also a good idea to check that all the assumptions are met. Outliers which result in a non-normal distribution of the residuals can severely bias the regression coefficients."

    "text": "7.6 Multiple linear regression\nIn the above example, we have only used a simple linear regression model of two continuous variables. Other more complex models can be built from this e.g. if we wanted to look at the effect of gender (male vs. female) as binary indicator in the model while adjusting for the effect of height. In that case we would include both the variables in the model as explanatory variables. In the same way we can include any number of explanatory variables (both continuous and categorical) in the model: this is called a multivariable model. Multivariable models are often used for building predictive equations, for example by using age, height, gender and smoking history to predict lung function, or to adjust for confounding and detect effect modification to investigate the association between an exposure and an outcome factor.\nMultiple regression has an important role in investigating causality in epidemiology. The exposure variable under investigation must stay in the model and the effects of other variables which can be confounders or effect-modifiers are tested. The biological, psychological or social meaning of the variables in the model and their interactions are of great importance for interpreting theories of causality.\nOther multivariable models include binary logistic regression for use with a binary outcome variable, or Cox regression for survival analyses. These models, together with multiple regression, will be taught in PHCM9517: Regression Methods in Biostatistics."

    "section": "8.2 Transforming non-normally distributed variables",
    "text": "8.2 Transforming non-normally distributed variables\nWhen a variable has a skewed distribution, one possibility is to transform the data to a new variable to try and obtain a normal or near normal distribution. Methods to transform non-normally distributed data include logarithmic transformation of each data point, or using the square root or the square or the inverse (i.e. 1/x) etc.\n\n8.2.1 Worked Example\nWe have data from 132 patients who had a hospital stay following admission to ICU available on Moodle (mod09_infection.dta.csv). The distribution of the length of stay for these patients is shown in the histogram in Figure 8.1. As is common with variables that record time, the data are skewed with many patients having relatively short stays and a few patients having very long hospital stays. Clearly, it would be inappropriate to use parametric statistical methods for these data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Length of hospital stay for 132 patients\n\n\n\n\nWhen data are positively skewed, as shown in Figure 8.1, a logarithmic transformation can often make the data closer to being normally distributed. This is the most common transformation used. You should note, however, that the logarithmic function cannot handle 0 or negative values. One way to deal with zeros in a set of data is to add 1 to each value before taking the logarithm.\nWe would generate a new variable, as shown in the Stata or R notes. As the minimum length of stay in these sample data was 0, we have added 1 to each length of stay before taking the logarithm. The distribution of the logarithm of (length of stay + 1) is shown in Figure 8.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: istribution of log transformed (length of stay + 1)\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution now appears much more bell shaped. Table 8.1 shows the descriptive statistics for length of stay before and after logarithmic transformation. Before transformation, the SD is almost as large as the mean value which indicates that the data are skewed and that these statistics are not an accurate description of the centre and spread of the data.\n\n\nTable 8.1: Summary statistics for untransformed and transformed length of stay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength of stay\nlog(Length of stay + 1)\n\n\n\n\nMean (Standard deviation)\n38.1 (35.78)\n3.41 (0.715)\n\n\nMean: 95% confidence interval\n31.9 to 44.2\n3.29 to 3.53\n\n\nMedian [Interquartile range]\n27 [21 to 42]\n3.3 [3.1 to 3.8]\n\n\nRange\n0 to 244\n0 to 5.5\n\n\n\n\nThe mean and standard deviation of the transformed length of stay are in log base e (i.e. ln) units. If we raise the mean of the log of length of stay to the power of \\(e\\), it returns a value of 30.2 days (\\(e^{3.41}=30.2\\)).\nTechnically, this is called the geometric mean of the data, and it has a different interpretation to the usual mean, the arithmetic mean. This is a much better estimate in this case of the “average” length of stay than the mean of 38.1 days (95% CI 31.9, 44.2 days) obtained from the non-transformed positively skewed data. Note that, if you have added 1 to your data to deal with 0 values, the back-transformed estimate is approximately equal to the geometric mean.\nThis set of data also includes a variable summarising whether a patient acquired a nosocomial infection (also known as healthcare-associated infections), which are infections that develop while undergoing medical treatment but were absent at the time of admission.\nIf we were testing the hypothesis that there was a difference in length of stay between groups (status of nosocomial infection), t-tests should not be used with length of stay, but could be used for the log transformed variable, which is approximately normally distributed. The output from the t-test of the log-transformed length of stay is shown in Table 8.2. This is done using the t-test shown in Module 5.\n\n\nTable 8.2: Summary statistics for transformed length of stay\n\n\nNosocomial infection\nn\nMean (SE)\n95% Confidence interval\n\n\n\n\nNo\n106\n3.33 (0.068)\n3.19 to 3.46\n\n\nYes\n26\n3.73 (0.136)\n3.45 to 4.01\n\n\nDifference (Yes - No)\n\n0.39 (0.153)\n0.09 to 0.70\n\n\n\n\nHere, a two-sample t-test gives a test statistic of 2.59 with 130 degrees of freedom, and a P-value of 0.01.\nAs explained above, the estimated statistics would need to be converted back to the units in which the variable was measured. From Output 9.2, we can take the exponential of the corresponding log-transformed values:\n\nthe geometric mean of the infected group is approximately 41.5 days with a 95% confidence interval from 31.4 to 55.0 days.\nthe geometric mean of the uninfected group is approximately 27.9 days with a 95% confidence interval from 24.4 to 31.9 days."

    "text": "8.3 Non-parametric significance tests\nIt is often not possible or sensible to transform a non-normal distribution, for example if there are too many zero values or when we simply want to compare groups using the unit in which the measurement was taken (e.g. length of stay). For this, non-parametric significance tests can be used but the general idea behind these tests is that the data values are replaced by ranks. This also protects against outliers having too much influence.\n\n8.3.1 Ranking variables\nTable 9.1 shows how ranks are calculated for the first 21 patients in the length-of-stay data (mod09_infection.dta.dta). First the data are sorted in order of their magnitude (from the lowest value to the highest) ignoring the group variable. Each data point is then assigned a rank. Data points that are equal are assigned the mean of their ranks. Thus, the two lengths of stay of 11 days share the ranks 4 and 5, and have a mean rank of 4.5. Similarly, there are 5 people with a length of stay of 14 days and these share the ranks 9 to 13, the mean of which is 11.

    "text": "8.4 Non-parametric test for two independent samples (Wilcoxon ranked sum test)\nThe non-parametric equivalent to an independent samples t-test (Module 5) is the Wilcoxon ranked sum test, also known as the Mann-Whitney U test. In Stata, this can be obtained using the ranksum command.\nThe assumption for this test is that the distributions of the two populations have the same general shape. If this assumption is met, then this test evaluates the null hypothesis that the medians of the two populations are equal. This test does not assume that the populations are normally distributed, nor that their variances are equal.\nFor the length of stay data in the Worked Example 9.1, we first get a ranks table as shown in Output 9.3. The rank sum table gives us a direction of effect that the ranks are higher than expected in patients who had nosocomial infection. While the positive infection group has a lower sum of ranks because there were fewer people who contracted an infection, it is higher than expected, i.e. they have a longer length of stay compared with the negative infection group. This ranks table does not provide any summary statistics of direction of effect, central tendency or spread that describe the data.\n\nStata Output 9.3: Wilcoxon rank-sum test\n\nTwo-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test\n\n      infect |      obs    rank sum    expected\n-------------+---------------------------------\n          No |      106        6620        7049\n         Yes |       26        2158        1729\n-------------+---------------------------------\n    combined |      132        8778        8778\n\nunadjusted variance    30545.67\nadjustment for ties      -53.87\n                     ----------\nadjusted variance      30491.80\n\nHo: los(infect==No) = los(infect==Yes)\n             z =  -2.457\n    Prob &gt; |z| =   0.0140\n    Exact Prob =   0.0135\n\nThe test statistics are shown under the rank sum table in Output 9.3. The variance shown immediately under the table are used to conduct the test, and are not reported on.\nFrom Output 9.3, there are two P-values shown: one assuming normality of the ranks (not the underlying data), and an “Exact” P-value. The exact P-value is calculated when the sample size is not too large (less than 200), and is preferred. The rounded exact P value is 0.014 which indicates that the there is evidence of a difference in length of stay between the groups. This P-value should be provided alongside non-parametric summary statistics such as medians and inter-quartile ranges.\nUsing the summary command with the detail option in Stata and splitting the LOS variable by the Infect variable (as shown in Module 5), we can obtain the median length of stay values of 24 (Interquartile Range: 19 to 40 days) in the group with no infection and 37 (Interquartile Range: 24 to 50 days) in the group with infection."

    "text": "8.5 Non-parametric test for paired data (Wilcoxon signed-rank test)\nThere are two types of non-parametric tests for paired data, called the Sign test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. In practice, the Sign test is rarely used and will not be discussed in this course.\nIf the differences between two paired measurements are not normally distributed, a non-parametric equivalent of a paired t-test (Module 5) should be used. The equivalent test is the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, also simply called the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. This test is resistant to outliers in the data, however the proportion of outliers in the sample should be small. This test evaluates the null hypothesis that the median of the paired differences is equal to zero.\nIn this test, the absolute differences between the paired scores are ranked and the difference scores that are equal to zero (i.e. scores where there is no difference between the pairs) are excluded. Thus, the test is not suitable when a large proportion of the differences are zero because the effective sample size is reduced considerably.\n\n8.5.1 Worked Example\nA crossover trial is done to compare symptom scores for two drugs in 11 people with arthritis (higher scores indicate more severe symptoms). The data are contained in Stata datafile file mod09_arthritis.csv. The data are shown in Table 9.2. The descriptive statistics indicate that the differences are not normally distributed. You can use the Explore function in Stata to determine this.\n\n\n\nArthritis symptom scores for 11 patients after administering two drugs\n\n\nPatient ID\nScore: Drug 1\nScore: Drug 2\nDifference (Drug 2 – Drug 1)\n\n\n1\n3\n4\n1\n\n\n2\n2\n7\n5\n\n\n3\n3\n4\n1\n\n\n4\n8\n10\n2\n\n\n5\n6\n8\n2\n\n\n6\n6\n1\n-5\n\n\n7\n2\n6\n4\n\n\n8\n3\n7\n4\n\n\n9\n5\n8\n3\n\n\n10\n9\n10\n1\n\n\n11\n7\n8\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore doing the analysis let us examine the distribution of the difference of symptom scores between the two drugs. As in Module 5, we first need to compute the difference between the symptom scores. To examine the distribution, we plot a histogram as shown in Figure @ref(fig:mod09-diff-hist).\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of difference in symptom scores between Drug 1 and Drug 2\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram shows that the differences are not normally distributed. The data looks negatively skewed with a gap in the histogram between the values of -5 and 0. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to conduct a paired t-test. Hence, we conduct a non-parametric paired test (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test).\nA non-parametric paired test can be obtained in Stata using the signrank command and the results of the test are shown in Output 9.4.\n\nStata Output 9.4: Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test\n\nWilcoxon signed-rank test\n\n        sign |      obs   sum ranks    expected\n-------------+---------------------------------\n    positive |        1        10.5          33\n    negative |       10        55.5          33\n        zero |        0           0           0\n-------------+---------------------------------\n         all |       11          66          66\n\nunadjusted variance      126.50\nadjustment for ties       -1.63\nadjustment for zeros       0.00\n                     ----------\nadjusted variance        124.88\n\nHo: drug_1 = drug_2\n             z =  -2.013\n    Prob &gt; |z| =   0.0441\n    Exact Prob =   0.0459\n\nThe table in Output 9.4 shows that there is 1 person who has a positive difference, where the symptom score on drug 2 that is smaller than that for drug 1 (i.e., drug 2 is better than drug 1); and 10 people who have a negative difference. No one has the same score for both drugs. The difference scores are ranked and the observed and expected sum of the ranks are shown in the output. This provides no intuitive summary statistics except to indicate which drug has higher ranks.\nThe test statistics are also shown under the table in Output 9.4. From the output, the exact P value of 0.046 indicates that there is evidence of a difference in symptom score between the two drugs."

    "text": "8.6 Non-parametric estimates of correlation\nEstimating correlation using Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be problematic when bivariate Normality cannot be assumed, or in the presence of outliers or skewness. There are two commonly used non-parametric alternatives to Pearson’s correlation coefficient: Spearman’s rank correlation (\\(\\rho\\) or rho), and Kendall’s rank correlation (\\(\\tau\\) or tau).\nWhen estimating the correlation between x and y, Spearman’s rank correlation essentially replaces the observations x and y by their ranks, and calculates the correlation between the ranks. Kendall’s rank correlation compares the ranks between every possible combination of pairs of data to measure concordance: whether high values for x tend to be associated with high values for y (positively correlated) or low values of y (negatively correlated).\nIn terms of which is the more appropriate measure to use, the following passage from An Introduction to Medical Statistics (Bland (2015)) provides some guidance:\n\n“Why have two different rank correlation coefficients? Spearman’s \\(\\rho\\) is older than Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\), and can be thought of as a simple analogue of the product moment correlation coefficient, Pearson’s r. Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\) is a part of a more general and consistent system of ranking methods, and has a direct interpretation, as the difference between the proportions of concordant and discordant pairs. In general, the numerical value of \\(\\rho\\) is greater than that of \\(\\tau\\). It is not possible to calculate \\(\\tau\\) from \\(\\rho\\) or \\(\\rho\\) from \\(\\tau\\), they measure different sorts of correlation. \\(\\rho\\) gives more weight to reversals of order when data are far apart in rank than when there is a reversal close together in rank, \\(\\tau\\) does not. However, in terms of tests of significance, both have the same power to reject a false null hypothesis, so for this purpose it does not matter which is used.”\n\nWe will illustrate estimating rank correlation using the Stata file mod08_lung_function.dta, which has information about height and lung function collected from a sample of 120 adults.\nThe Spearman rank correlation coefficient is estimated as 0.75, demonstrating a positive association between height and FVC. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient is estimated as 0.56, again demonstrating a positive association between height and FVC."

Non-parametric methods do not assume any distribution for the data and use significance tests based on ranks or sign (or both). A non-parametric test is always less powerful than its equivalent parametric test if the data are normally distributed and so whenever possible parametric significance tests should be used. In some cases when data are not normally distributed with a reasonably large sample size, the data can be transformed (most commonly by log transformation) to make the distribution normal. A parametric significance test should then be used with the transformed data to test the hypothesis."

To test the hypothesis that patients with nosocomial infection have a different length of stay to patients without infection, you can conduct a t-test on the ln_los variable.

    "text": "9.1 Introduction\nDetermining the appropriate sample size (the number of participants in a study) is one of the most critical issues when designing a research study. A common question when planning a project is “How many participants do I need?” The sample size needs to be large enough to ensure that the results can be generalised to the population and will be accurate, but small enough for the study question to be answered with the resources available. In general, the larger the sample size, the more precise the study results will be.\nUnfortunately, estimating the sample size required for a study is not straightforward and the method used varies with the study design and the type of statistical test that will be conducted on the data collected. In the past, researchers calculated the sample size by hand using complicated mathematical formula. More recently, look-up tables have been created which has removed the need for hand calculations. Now, most researchers use computer programs where parameters relevant to the particular study design are entered and the sample size is automatically calculated. In this module, we will use an abbreviated look-up table to demonstrate the parameters that need to be considered when estimating sample sizes for a confidence interval and use software for all other sample size calculations. The look-up table allows you to see at a glance, the impact of different factors on the sample size estimation.\n\n9.1.1 Under and over-sized studies\nIn health research, there are different implications for interpreting the results if the sample size is too small or too large.\nAn under-sized study is one which lacks the power to find an effect or association when, in truth, one exists. If the sample size is too small, an important difference between groups may not be statistically significant and so will not be detected by the study. In fact, it is considered unethical to conduct a health study which is poorly designed so that it is not possible to detect an effect or association if it exists. Often, Ethics Committees request evidence of sample size calculations before a study is approved.\nA classic paper by Freiman et al examined 71 randomised controlled trials which reported an absence of clinical effect between two treatments.(Freiman et al. 1978) Many of the trials were too small to show that a clinically important difference was statistically significant. If the sample size of an analytic study is too small, then only very limited conclusions can be drawn about the results.\nIn general, the larger the sample size the more precise the estimates will be. However, large sample sizes have their own effect on the interpretation of the results. An over-sized study is one in which a small difference between groups, which is not important in clinical or public health terms, is statistically significant. When the study sample is large, the null hypothesis could be rejected in error and research resources may be wasted. This type of study may be unethical due to the unnecessary enrolment of a large number of people."

    "text": "9.2 Sample size estimation for descriptive studies\nTo estimate the sample size required for a descriptive study, we usually focus on specifying the width of the confidence interval around our primary estimate. For example, to estimate the sample size for a study designed to measure a prevalence we need to:\n\nnominate the expected prevalence based on other available evidence;\nnominate the required level of precision around the estimate. For this, the width of the 95% confidence interval (i.e. the distance equal to 1.96 \\(\\times\\) SE) is used.\n\nTable 10.1 is an abbreviated look-up table that we can use to estimate the sample size for this type of study. Note that the sample size required to detect an expected population prevalence of 5% is the same as to detect a prevalence of 95%. Similarly 10% is equivalent to 90% etc. It is symmetric about 50%. From Table 9.1, you can see that the sample size required increases as the expected prevalence approaches 50% and as the precision increases (i.e. the required 95% CI becomes narrower).\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.1: Sample size required to calculate a 95% confidence interval with a given precision\n\n\n\nWidth of 95% confidence interval (precision)\n\n\nPrevalence\n1%\n1.5%\n2%\n2.5%\n3%\n3.5%\n4%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n\n\n5% or 95%\n1,825\n812\n457\n292\n203\n149\n115\n\n\n\n\n\n10% or 90%\n3,458\n1,537\n865\n554\n385\n283\n217\n139\n\n\n\n\n15% or 85%\n4,899\n2,177\n1,225\n784\n545\n400\n307\n196\n49\n\n\n\n20% or 80%\n6,147\n2,732\n1,537\n984\n683\n502\n385\n246\n62\n28\n\n\n25% or 75%\n7,203\n3,202\n1,801\n1,153\n801\n588\n451\n289\n73\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.1 Worked Example\nA descriptive cross-sectional study is designed to measure the prevalence of bronchitis in children age 0-2 years with a 95% CI of \\(\\pm\\) 4%.

    "text": "9.3 Sample size estimation for analytic studies\nAnalytic study designs are used to compare characteristics between different groups in the population. The main study designs are analytic cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, cohort studies and randomised controlled trials. For analytic study designs, the outcome measure of interest can be a mean value, a proportion or a relative risk if a random sample has been enrolled. For case-control studies the most appropriate measure of association is an odds ratio.\n\n9.3.1 Factors to be considered\nThe first important decision in estimating a required sample size for an analytic study is to select the type of statistical test that will be used to report or analyse the data. Each type of test is associated with a different method of sample size estimation.\nOnce the statistical method has been determined, the following issues need to be decided:\n\nStatistical power: the chance of finding a difference if one exists, e.g. 80%;\nLevel of significance: the P value that will be considered significant, e.g. P&lt;0.05;\nMinimum effect size of interest: the size of the difference between groups e.g. the difference in the proportion of parents who oppose immunisation in two different regions or the difference in mean values of blood pressure in two groups of people with different types of cardiac disease;\nVariability: the spread of the measurements, e.g. the expected standard deviation of the main outcome variable (if continuous), or the expected proportions;\nResources: an estimate of the number of participants available and amount of funding to run the study.\n\nIn addition to deciding the level of power and probability that will be used, the difference between groups that is regarded as being important has to be estimated. The smallest difference between study groups that we want to detect is described as the minimum expected effect size. This is determined on the basis of clinical judgement, public health importance and expertise in the condition being researched, or may it be need to be determined from a pilot study or a literature review. The smaller the expected effect or association, the larger the sample size will need to obtain statistical significance. We also need some knowledge of how variable the measurement is expected to be. For this we often use the standard deviation for a continuous measure. As measurement variability increases, the sample size will need to increase in order to detect the expected difference between the groups. Above all, a study has to be practical in terms of the availability of a population from which to draw sufficient numbers for the study and in terms of the funds that are available to conduct the study.\n\n\n9.3.2 Power and significance level\nThe power of a study, which was discussed in Module 4, is the chance of finding a statistically significant difference when one exists, i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis. The relationship between the power of a study and statistical significance is shown in Table 9.2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.2: Comparison of study result with the truth\n\n\nStudy result\nTruth\n\n\n\nEffect\nNo effect\n\n\nEvidence\n✓\nɑ\n\n\nNo evidence\nβ\n✓\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of a study is expressed as 1– β where β is the probability of a false negative (that is, the probability of a Type II error - incorrectly not rejecting the null hypothesis. In most research, power is generally set to 80% (a Type II error rate of 20%). However, in some studies, especially in some clinical trials where rigorous results are required, power is set to 90% (a Type II error rate of 10%).\nThe significance level, or α level, is the level at which the P value of a test is considered to be statistically significant. The α level is usually set at 5% indicating a probability of &lt;0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant. Occasionally, especially if several outcome measures are being compared, the α level is set at 1% indicating a probability of &lt;0.01 will be regarded as statistically significant.\nThe calculation of sample sizes for analytic studies are based on calculations that are somewhat tedious to compute by hand. Software packages are the standard method of calculating sample sizes for these types of study, and examples from both R and Stata will be provided."

    "text": "9.4 Detecting the difference between two means\nThe test that is used to show that two mean values are significantly different from one another is the independent samples t-test (Module 5). The sample size needed for this test to have sufficient power can be calculated using R and Stata as shown in the Worked Example below.\n\n9.4.1 Worked Example\nThere is a hypothesis that the use of the oral contraceptive (OC) pill in premenopausal women can increase systolic blood pressure. A study was planned to test this hypothesis using a two sided t-test. The investigators are interesting in detecting an increase of at least 5 mm Hg systolic blood pressure in the women using OC compared to the non-OC users with 90% power at a 5% significance level. A pilot study shows that the SD of systolic blood pressure in the target group is 25 mm Hg and the mean systolic blood pressure of non-OC user women is 90 mm Hg. What is the minimum number of women in each group that need to be recruited for the study to detect this difference?\nSolution The effect size of interest is 5 mm Hg and the associated standard deviation is 25 mm Hg. For power of 90% and alpha of 5%, the sample size calculation using the Stata can be calculated using the power twomeans command:\n\nOutput 10.1: Two independent samples t-test sample size calculation\n\n. power twomeans 90 95, sd(25) power(0.9)\n\nPerforming iteration ...\n\nEstimated sample sizes for a two-sample means test\nt test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd\nHo: m2 = m1 versus  Ha: m2 != m1\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500\n        power =    0.9000\n        delta =    5.0000\n           m1 =   90.0000\n           m2 =   95.0000\n           sd =   25.0000\n\nEstimated sample sizes:\n\n            N =     1,054\n  N per group =       527\n\nWe can use the epi.sscompc function within the epiR package in R to calculate the sample size:\n\nlibrary(epiR)\nlibrary(pwr)\n\nepi.sscompc(treat=90, control=95, n=NA, sigma=25, power=0.9)\n\n$n.total\n[1] 1052\n\n$n.treat\n[1] 526\n\n$n.control\n[1] 526\n\n$power\n[1] 0.9\n\n$delta\n[1] 5\n\n\nNote that Stata and R provide slightly different estimated sample sizes. This difference is immaterial from a practical point of view, and highlights the importance of referencing which software package has been used when writing up results.\nFrom the output, we can see that with 90% power we will need 526 or 527 participants in each group, i.e., 1052 or 1054 participants in total.\nIf the above were carried out by taking baseline measures of systolic blood pressure, and then again when the women were taking the OC pills, it would be a matched-pair study. Computing sample sizes for paired studies requires an estimate of the correlation between the paired obervations. If we do not have any estimates for this correlation, we can assume a value of 0. If the correlation is positive, a zero for correlation would give a more conservative estimate of sample size required (i.e. estimate a sample size larger than necessary). While a negative correlation would require a bigger sample size than a zero correlation, it is relatively uncommon to encounter negative correlations between pairs. Any discussions on the effect of correlation on sample size is beyond the scope of this course. Thus, we will always assume a correlation of zero between paired measurements in this course.\nWe can compute the required sample size in Stata using the power pairedmeans command:\n\n\nOutput 10.2: Paired samples t-test sample size using Worked Example 10.2\n\n. power pairedmeans 90 95, corr(0) power(0.9) sd(25)\n\nPerforming iteration ...\n\nEstimated sample size for a two-sample paired-means test\nPaired t test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd\nHo: d = d0  versus  Ha: d != d0\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500          ma1 =   90.0000\n        power =    0.9000          ma2 =   95.0000\n        delta =    0.1414           sd =   25.0000\n           d0 =    0.0000         corr =    0.0000\n           da =    5.0000\n         sd_d =   35.3553\n\nEstimated sample size:\n\n            N =       528\n\nAs discussed in the R notes, calculating the sample size required for a paired t-test is a little more cumbersome in R. Here, only the output of the process is provided - refer to the R notes for detail on the code.\n\n\nOutput 10.2: Paired samples t-test sample size using Worked Example 10.2\n\n\n\n     Paired t test power calculation \n\n              n = 527.2954\n              d = 0.1414214\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*\n\n\nAssuming a correlation of 0 between the two sets of measurements, we can see that we will need 528 pairs of measurements to achieve a power of 90% (virtually the same as for an independent samples study)."

Occasionally, we may not know the expected proportion in one of the groups, e.g. in a randomised control trial of a novel intervention. In the sample size calculation for such a study, we should instead justify the minimum expected difference between the proportions based on what is important from a clinical or public health perspective. Based on the minimum difference, we can then derive the expected proportion for both groups. Note that the smaller the difference, the larger the sample size required.\nThe sample size required in each group to observe a difference in two independent proportions can be calculated using the power twoproportions command in Stata.\n\n9.5.1 Worked Example\nIf we expect that the prevalence of smoking in two comparison groups (e.g. males and females) will be 35% and 20%.

    "text": "9.6 Detecting an association using a relative risk\nThe relative risk is used to describe the association between an exposure and an outcome variable if the sample has been randomly selected from the population. This statistic is often used to describe the effect or association of an exposure in a cross-sectional or cohort study or the effect/association of a treatment in an randomised controlled trial. To estimate the sample size required for the RR to have a statistically significant P value, i.e. to show a significant association, we need to define: - the size of the RR that is considered to be of clinical or public health importance; - the event rate (rate of outcome) among the group who are not exposed to the factor of interest (reference group); - the desired level of significance (usually 0.05); - the desired power of the study (usually 80% or 90%).\nIn general, a RR of 2.0 or greater is considered to be of public health importance, however, a smaller RR can be important when exposure is high. For example, there may be a relatively small risk of respiratory infection among young children with a parent who smokes (RR ~ 1.2). If 25% of children are exposed to smoking in their home, then the high exposure rate leads to a very large number of children who have preventable respiratory infections across the community.\n\n9.6.1 Worked Example\nA study is planned to investigate the effect of an environmental exposure on the incidence of a certain common disease. In the general (unexposed) population the incidence rate of the disease is 50% and it is assumed that the incidence rate would be 75% in the exposed population. Thus the relative risk of interest would be 1.5 (i.e. 0.75 / 0.50). We want to detect this effect with 90% power at a 5% level of significance.\nWe can use the Stata command power twoproportions as below:\n\n9.6.1.1 Output 10.4: Sample size calculation for relative risk\n\nEstimated sample sizes for a two-sample proportions test\nPearson's chi-squared test \nHo: p2 = p1  versus  Ha: p2 != p1\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500\n        power =    0.9000\n        delta =    1.5000  (relative risk)\n           p1 =    0.5000\n           p2 =    0.7500\n        rrisk =    1.5000\n\nEstimated sample sizes:\n\n            N =       154\n  N per group =        77\n\nFrom Output 10.4, we can see that for a control proportion of 0.5 and RR of 1.5, we need a total sample size of 154, that is 77 people would be needed in each of the exposure groups.\nThe epiR package does not have a function to estimate sample size and power directly for a relative risk, but we can use the epi.sscohortc function. To do this, we recognise that the assumed rate in the exposed group will equal the rate in the unexposed group multiplied by the relative risk.\nHere we define the risk in the unexposed group as 0.5 and the desired relative risk to detect is 1.5.

    "text": "9.8 Factors that influence power\n\n9.8.1 Dropouts\nIt is common to increase estimated sample sizes to allow for drop-outs or non-response. To account for drop-outs, the estimated sample size can be divided by (1 minus the dropout rate). Consider the following case:\n\nn-completed: the number who will complete the study (i.e. n after drop-out)\nn-recruited: the number who should be recruited (i.e. n before drop-out)\nd: drop-out rate (as a proportion - i.e. a number between 0 and 1)\n\nThen n-completed = n-recruited × (1 - d)\nRe-arranging this formula gives: n-recruited = n-completed ÷ (1 - d).\n\n\n9.8.2 Unequal groups\nMany factors that come into play in a study can reduce the estimated power of a study. In clinical trials, it is not unusual for recruitment goals to be much harder to achieve than expected and therefore for the target sample size to be impossible to realise within the timeframe planned for recruitment.\nIn case-control studies, the number of potential case participants available may be limited but study power can be maintained by enrolling a greater number of controls than cases. Or in an experimental study, more participants may be randomised to the new treatment group to test its effects accurately when much is known about the effect of standard care and a more precise estimate of the new treatment effect is required.\nHowever, there is a trade-off between increasing the ratio of group size and the total number that needs to be enrolled. Consider Worked Example @ref(wex10-5): selecting an equal number of controls and cases would require 188 cases and 188 controls, a total of 376 participants.\nWe may want to reduce the number of cases required, by selecting 2 controls for every case. When performing sample size calculations with unequal groups, Stata refers to cases as N2, and controls as N1. Selecting 2 controls (N1) per case (N2) (corresponding to a ratio of N2/N1 0.5 in Stata) would require 140 cases and 280 controls, a total of 420 participants. We can extend this example and investigate the impact of changing the ratio of controls per case.\n\n\n\nIncreasing the number of controls per case\n\n\nControls per case\nStata's allocation ratio (N2/N1)     \nNumber of cases required\nNumber of controls required\nTotal participants required\n\n\n1\n1     \n188\n188\n376\n\n\n2\n0.5   \n140\n280\n420\n\n\n3\n0.3333\n124\n371\n495\n\n\n4\n0.25  \n116\n462\n578\n\n\n5\n0.2   \n111\n553\n664\n\n\n6\n0.1666\n108\n644\n752\n\n\n7\n0.1429\n105\n734\n839\n\n\n8\n0.125 \n104\n825\n929\n\n\n9\n0.1111\n102\n916\n1,018\n\n\n10\n0.1   \n101\n1,006\n1,107\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be visualised graphically, as in Figure 9.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Increasing the number of controls per case\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the number of cases required drops off if we go from 1 to 2 controls per case, and again from 2 to 3 controls per case. Once we go from 3 to 4 controls per case, we only reduce the number of cases by 8 (124 vs 116 cases), but at an increase of 91 (371 vs 462) controls. Clearly, this reduction in cases is not offset by the extra controls required.\nIn Stata, nratio is experimental group / control group.

    "text": "9.9 Limitations in sample size estimations\nIn this module we have seen how to use Stata for estimating the sample size requirement of a study given the statistical test that will be used and the expected characteristics of the sample. However, once a study is underway, it is not unusual for sample size to be compromised by the lack of research resources, difficulties in recruiting participants or, in a clinical trial, participants wanting to change groups when information about the new experimental treatment rapidly becomes available in the press or on the internet.\nOne approach that is increasingly being used is to conduct a blinded interim analysis say when 50% of the total data that are planned have been collected. In this, a statistician external to the research team who is blinded to the interpretation of the group code is asked to measure the effect size in the data with the sole aim of validating the sample size requirement. It is rarely a good idea to use an interim analysis to reduce the planned sample size and terminate a trial early because the larger the sample size, the greater the precision with which the treatment effect is estimated. However, interim analyses are useful for deciding whether the sample size needs to be increased in order to answer the study question and avoid a Type II error."

We have looked at the parameters that need to be considered when estimating the sample size for different studies and have used a look-up table to estimate required sample size for a prevalence study and Stata to estimate appropriate sample sizes in epidemiological research under the most straightforward situations. The common requirement in all the situations is that the researchers need to specify the minimum effect measure (e.g. difference in means, OR, RR etc) they want to detect with a given probability (usually 80% to 90%) at a certain level of significance (usually P&lt;0.05). The ultimate decision on the sample size depends on a compromise among different objectives such as power, minimum effect size, and available resources. To make the final decision, it is helpful to do some trial calculations using revised power and the minimum detectable effect measure."
