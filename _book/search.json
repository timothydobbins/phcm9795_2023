In this module, we introduce hypothesis testing as the basis of the statistical tests that are important for reporting results from research and surveillance studies, and that you will be learning in the remainder of this course.\nWe use hypothesis testing to answer questions such as whether two groups have different health outcomes or whether there is an association between a treatment and a health outcome. For example, we may want to know:\n\nwhether a safety program has been effective in reducing injuries in a factory, i.e. whether the frequency of injuries in the group who attended a safety program is lower than in the group who did not receive the safety program;\nwhether a new drug is more effective in reducing blood pressure than a conventional drug, i.e. whether the mean blood pressure in the group receiving the new drug is lower than the mean blood pressure in the group receiving the conventional medication;\nwhether an environmental exposure increases the risk of a disease, i.e. whether the frequency of disease is higher in the group who have been exposed to an environmental factor than in the non-exposed group.\n\nWe may also want to know something about a single group. For example, whether the mean blood pressure of a sample is the same as the general population.\nThese questions can be answered by setting up a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, and performing a hypothesis test (also known as a significance test)."

    "text": "3.2 Hypothesis testing\nHypothesis testing is a statistical technique that is used to quantify the evidence against a null hypothesis. A null hypothesis (H0) is a statement that there is no difference in a summary statistic between groups. For example, a null hypothesis may be stated as follows:\nH0 = there is no difference in mean systolic blood pressure between a group taking a conventional drug and a group taking a newly developed drug\nWe also have an alternative hypothesis that is opposite or contrasting to the null hypothesis. In our example above, the alternative hypothesis above we be that there is a difference between groups. The alternative hypothesis is usually of most interest to the researcher but in practice, formal statistical tests are used to test the null hypothesis (not the alternative hypothesis). The hypotheses are always in reference to the population from which the sample is drawn, not the sample itself.\nAfter setting up our null and alternative hypotheses, we use the data to generate a test statistic. The particular test statistic differs depending on the type of data being analyses (e.g. continuous or categorical), the study design (e.g. paired or independent) and the question being asked.\nThe test statistic is then compared to a known distribution to calculate the probability of observing a test statistic which is as large or larger than the observed test statistic, if the null hypothesis was true. The probability is known as the P-value. Informally, the P-value can be interpreted as the probability of observing data like ours, or more extreme, if the null hypothesis was true.\nIf the P-value is small, it is unlikely that we would observe data like ours or more extreme if the null hypothesis was true. In other words, our data are not consistent with the null hypothesis, and we conclude that we have evidence against the null hypothesis. If the P-value is not small, the probability of observing data like ours or more extreme is not unlikely. We therefore have little or no evidence against the null hypothesis. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis cannot be proven or accepted; we can only find evidence to refute the null hypothesis.\nTo summarise:\n\na small P-value gives us evidence against the null hypothesis;\na P-value that is not small provides little or no evidence against null hypothesis;\nthe smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nHistorically, a value of 0.05 has been used as a cut-point for finding evidence against the null hypothesis. A P-value less than 0.05 would be interpreted as “statistically significant”, and would allow us to “reject the null hypothesis”. A P-value greater than 0.05 would be interpreted as “not significant”, and we would “fail to reject the null hypothesis”. This arbitrary dichotomy is overly simplistic, and a more nuanced view is now recommended. Possible interpretations for P-values are given in Table 3.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1:  Interpretation of P-values \n\nSize of P valueStrength of evidence\n\n<0.001Very strong evidence\n\n0.001 to <0.01Strong evidence\n\n0.01 to <0.05Evidence\n\n0.05 to <0.1Weak evidence\n\n≥0.1Little or no evidence\n\n\n\n\n\nP-values are usually generated using statistical software although other methods such as statistical tables or Excel functions can be used to generate test statistics and determine the P-value. In traditional statistics, the probability level was described as a lower-case p but in many journals today, probability is commonly described by upper case P. Both have the same meaning."

    "text": "3.3 Effect size\nIn hypothesis testing, P-values convey only part of the information about the hypothesis and need to be accompanied by an estimation of the effect size, that is, a description of the magnitude of the difference between the study groups. The effect size is a summary statistic that conveys the size of the difference between two groups. For continuous variables, it is usually calculated as the difference between two mean values.\nIf the variable is binary, the effect size can be expressed as the absolute difference between two proportions (attributable risk), or as an odds ratio or relative risk.\nReporting the effect size enables clinicians and other researchers to judge whether a statistically significant result is also a clinically important finding. The size of the difference or the risk statistic provides information to help health professionals decide whether the observed effect is large and important enough to warrant a change in current health care practice, is equivocal and suggests a need for further research, or is small and clinically unimportant."

    "text": "3.4 Statistical significance and clinical importance\nWhen applying statistical methods in health and medical research, we need to make an informed decision about whether the effect size that led to a statistically significant finding is also clinically important (see Figure 3.1)). The decision about whether a statistically significant result is also clinically important depends on expert knowledge and is best made by practitioners with experience in the field.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Statistical significance vs. clinical importance (Source: Armitage P, Berry G, Matthews JNS. (2001)\n\n\nIt is possible when conducting significance tests, particularly in very large studies, that a small effect is found to be statistically significant. For example, say in a large study of over 1000 patients, a new medication was found to lower blood pressure on average by 1 mmHg more than a currently accepted drug and this was statistically significant (P < 0.05). However, such a small decrease in blood pressure would probably not be considered clinically important. The cost and side effects of prescribing the new medication would need to be weighed against the very small average benefit that would be expected. In this case, although the null hypothesis would be rejected (i.e. the result is statistically significant), the result would not be clinically important. This is the situation described in scenario (c) of Figure Figure 3.1.\nConversely, it is possible to obtain a large, clinically important difference between groups, but a P value that does not demonstrate a statistically significant difference.\nFor example, consider a study to measure the rate of hospital admissions. We may find that 80% of children who present to the Emergency Department are admitted before an intervention is introduced compared to only 65% of children after the intervention. However, the P value may be calculated as 0.11 and is non-significant. This is because only 60 children were surveyed in each period. Here, the reduction in the admission rate by 15% represents a clinically important difference, but not statistically significant. This situation is represented in scenario (d) of Figure 3.1.\nThe important thing to remember is that statistical significance does not always correspond to clinical importance. A statistically significant result may be clinically unimportant, and a statistically non-significant results may be clinically important."

If the P-value is not small, there is little evidence against the null hypothesis and we fail to reject the null hypothesis. As discussed above, the “small” cut-point for the P-value is often taken as 0.05. We refer to this value as \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha).\nWe can conduct a thought experiment and compare our hypothesis test conclusion to reality. In reality, either the null hypothesis is true, or it is false. Of course, if we knew what reality was, we would not need to conduct a hypothesis test. But we can compare our possible hypothesis test conclusions to the true (unobserved) reality.\nIf the null hypothesis was true in reality, our hypothesis test can fail to reject the null hypothesis – this would be a correct conclusion. However, the hypothesis test could lead us to rejecting the null hypothesis – this would be an incorrect conclusion. We call this scenario a Type I error, and it has a probability of \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe other situation is where, in reality, the null hypothesis is false. A correct conclusion would be where our hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis. However, if our hypothesis test fails to reject the null hypothesis, we have made a Type II error. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted \\(\\beta\\) (beta). We will see in Module 10 that \\(\\beta\\) is determined by the size of the study.\nThe error in falsely rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (type I error), or in falsely accepting the null hypothesis when it is not true (type II error) is summarised in Table 3.2. We will return to these concepts in Module 10, when discussing how to determine the appropriate sample size of a study.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2:  Comparison of study result with the truth \n\nStudy resultTruth\n\n EffectNo effect\n\nEvidenceCorrect conclusionɑ\n\nNo evidenceβCorrect conclusion"

    "text": "3.6 Confidence intervals in hypothesis testing\nIn Module 3, the 95% confidence interval around a mean value was calculated to show the precision of the summary statistic. The 95% confidence intervals around other summary statistics can also be calculated.\nFor example, if we were comparing the means of two groups, we would want to test the null hypothesis that the difference in means is zero, that there is no true difference between the groups.\nFrom the data from the two groups, we could estimate the difference in means, the standard error of the difference in means and the 95% confidence interval around the difference. To estimate the 95% confidence interval, we use the formula given in Module 3, that is:\n\\[ 95\\% \\text{ CI} = \\text{Difference in means} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(\\text{Difference in means)} \\]\nIt is important to remember that the 95% CI is estimated from the standard error, and that the standard error has a direct relationship to the sample size. For small sample sizes, the standard error is large and the 95% CI becomes wider. Conversely, the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error and the narrower the 95% CI becomes indicating a more precise estimate of the mean difference.\nThe 95% CI tells us the region in which we are 95% confident that the true difference between the groups in the population lies. If this region contains the null value of no difference, we can say that we are 95% confident that there is no true difference between the groups and therefore we would not reject the null hypothesis. This is shown in the top two estimates in Figure 3.2. If the zero value lies outside the 95% confidence interval, we can conclude that there is evidence of a difference between the groups because we are 95% confident that the difference does not encompass a zero value (as shown in the lower two estimates in Figure 3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Using confidence intervals as informal hypothesis tests\n\n\n\n\nFor relative risk and odds ratio measures, when the 95% CI includes the value of 1 it indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true RR or OR of the association between the study factor and outcome factor includes 1.0 in the source population. This indicates little evidence of an association between the study factor and the outcome factor, e.g. if the results of a study were reported as RR = 1.10 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.25). The P-value can be calculated to assess this (discussed in Module 7).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3:  Values indicating no effect \n\nType of outcomeMeasure of effectNull value\n\n(indicating no difference)\n\nContinuousDifference in means0\n\nBinaryDifference in proportions0\n\nRelative risk1\n\nOdds ratio1"

The t-distribution and its relation to normal distribution has been discussed in detailed in Module 3.\nIn a one-sample t-test, a t-value is computed as the sample mean divided by the standard error of the mean. The significance of the t-value is then computed using software, or can be obtained from a statistical table.\nThe principles of this test can be used for applications such as testing whether the mean of a sample is different from a known population mean, for example testing whether the IQ of a group of children is different from the population mean of 100 IQ points or testing whether the number of average hours worked in an adult sample is different from the population mean of 38 hours.\n\n3.7.1 Worked Example\nThe mean diastolic blood pressure (BP) of the general US population is known to be 71 mm Hg. The diastolic blood pressure of 733 female Pima indigenous Americans was measured and a histogram showed that the data were approximately normally distributed. The mean diastolic blood pressure in the sample was 72.4 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 12.38 mm Hg.\nWe can use Stata or R to conduct a one sample t-test using the data available on Moodle (Example_4.1.csv). The results from this test are summarised below.\n\n\nTable 3.4: Summary of blood pressure from female Pima indigenous Americans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\nMean\nStandard deviation\nStandard error\n95% confidence interval of the mean\n\n\n\n\n733\n72.4\n12.38\n0.46\n71.5 to 73.3\n\n\n\n\nThe test statistic for the one-sample t-test is calculated as t732=3.07, with a P-value of 0.002.\nThe mean diastolic blood pressure of females from Pima is estimated as 72.4 mmHg (95% CI: 71.5 to 73.3 mmHg), which is higher than that of the general US population. Note that this interval does not contain the mean of the general US population (71 mm Hg), providing some indication that the mean diastolic blood pressure of female Pima people is higher than that of the general US population.\nThe result from the formal hypothesis test gives strong evidence that the mean diastolic BP of the female Pima people is higher than that of the general US population (t732=3.07, P=0.002)."

    "section": "3.8 One and two tailed tests",
    "text": "3.8 One and two tailed tests\nMost statistical tests are two tailed tests, that is, we conduct a test that allows for the summary statistic in the group of interest to be either higher or lower than in the comparison group. For a t-test, this requires that we obtain a two-tailed P value which gives us the probability of the t-value being in either one of the two tails of the t-distribution as shown in Figure 3.3. The shaded regions show the t values that indicate a P value less than 0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: P-value for a 2-tailed test\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally, one tailed tests are conducted in which the summary statistic in the group of interest can only be higher or lower than the comparison group, i.e. a difference is specified to occur in one direction only. This makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis because the consequence is that the P value is essentially halved. The P value for a one tailed test would be 0.025 i.e. the shaded region for a one-tailed test would be doubled on one side of the distribution and eliminated from the other side of the distribution as shown in Figure 3.4.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: P-value for 1-tailed tests\n\n\n\n\nIf a one tailed P value is reported, and is considered to be an invalid decision, it is usually easily converted to a two tailed value by doubling its numeric value. For example, for the same test statistic and sample size:\n\nOne tailed P value = 0.042 i.e. statistically significant\nTwo tailed P value = 0.084 i.e. non-significant\n\nObviously, the choice of whether to use a one or two tailed test is not as important when the P value is highly significant or clearly non-significant but can make a difference to the conclusions when the P value is on the margins of significance.\nIn most health research, the use of a one tailed test is rarely justified because it is unusual to be certain of the direction of effect prior to the research study being undertaken. It has been suggested that if the researchers were sure enough to consider using a one-tailed test, the research study would not be needed.\nIn most studies, two tailed tests of significance are used to allow for the possibility that the effect size could occur in either direction. In clinical trials, this would mean allowing for a result that can indicate a benefit or an adverse effect in response to a new treatment. In epidemiological studies, two tailed tests are used to allow for the fact that exposure to a factor of interest may be adverse or may be beneficial. This conservative approach is usually adopted to prevent missing important effects that occur in the opposite direction to that expected by the researchers."

    "text": "Activity 4.1\nIn each of the following situations, what decision should be made about the null hypothesis if the researcher indicates that:\n\nP < 0.01\nP > 0.05\n“ns”\n“significant differences exist”\n\n\n\nActivity 4.2\nFor the following hypothetical situations, formulate the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis and write a conclusion about the study results:\n\nA study was conducted to investigate whether the mean systolic blood pressure of males aged 40 to 60 years was different to the mean systolic blood pressure of females aged 40 to 60 years. The result of the study was that the mean systolic blood pressure was higher in males by 5.1 mmHg (95% CI 2.4 to 7.6; P = 0.008).\nA case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between obesity and breast cancer. The researchers found an OR of 3.21 (95% CI 1.15 to 8.47; P = 0.03).\nA cohort study investigated the relationship between eating a healthy diet and the incidence of influenza infection among adults aged 20 to 60 years. The results were RR = 0.88 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.50; P = 0.2).\n\n\n\nActivity 4.3\nA pilot study was conducted to compare the mean daily energy intake of women aged 25 to 30 years with the recommended intake of 7750 kJ/day. In this study, the average daily energy intake over 10 days was recorded for 12 healthy women of that age group. The data are in the the Excel file Activity_4.3.xls. Import the file into Stata for this activity.\n\nState the research question\nFormulate the null hypothesis\nFormulate the alternative hypothesis\nAnalyse the data in Stata and report your conclusions\n\n\n\nActivity 4.4\nWhich procedure gives the researcher the better chance of rejecting a null hypothesis?\n\ncomparing the data-based p-value with the level of significance at 5%\ncomparing the 95% CI with a nominated value\nneither procedure\n\n\n\nActivity 4.5\nSetting the significance level at P < 0.10 instead of the more usual P < 0.05 increases the likelihood of:\n\na Type I error\na Type II error\nrejecting the null hypothesis\nNot rejecting the null hypothesis\n\n\n\nActivity 4.6\nFor a fixed sample size setting the significance level at a very extreme cutoff such as P < 0.001 increases the chances of: a) obtaining a significant result b) rejecting the null hypothesis c) a Type I error d) a Type II error"
