## Calculating a 95% confidence interval of a mean: Individual data {#sec-cimean-stata-ind}

To demonstrate the computation of the 95% confidence interval of a mean we have used data from `Example_1.3.dta`. To calculate the 95% confidence interval, go to **Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Summary and descriptive statistics > Confidence intervals**. In the **ci** dialog box, select `weight` as the **Variable**.

```{r fig-mod3-ci, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
#| fig-cap: Calculating a confidence interval from individual data

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod03", "stata", "mod3-ci.png"))
```

Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain Output 3.1.

[Command: `ci means weight`]

## Calculating a 95% confidence interval of a mean: Summarised data {#sec-cimean-stata-summ}

For Worked Example 3.2 where we are given the sample mean, sample standard deviation and sample size, we use the `cii means` command. To calculate the 95% CI, go to **Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Summary and descriptive statistics > Normal mean CI calculator**. In the **cii** dialog box, check that the **Normal mean** button is selected, and enter `30` as the **Sample size**, `70` as the **Sample mean**, `6` as the **Sample standard deviation** and check that `95` in entered as the **Confidence level**.

```{r fig-mod3-cii, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
#| fig-cap: Calculating a confidence interval from summarised data

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod03", "stata", "mod3-cii.png"))
```
 
Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain the following output:

#### Stata Output 3.2: 95%CI for a given sample mean, sample standard deviation and sample size {-}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, highlight=FALSE}
. cii means 30 70 6
